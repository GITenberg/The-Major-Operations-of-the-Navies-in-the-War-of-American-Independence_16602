<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The contents of this volume were first contributed as a
chapter, under the title of "Major Operations, 1762-1783,"
to the "History of the Royal Navy," in seven volumes, published
by Messrs. Sampson Low, Marston, and Company,
under the general editorship of the late Sir William Laird
Clowes. For permission to republish now in this separate
form, the author has to express his thanks to the publishers of that work.</p>

<p>In the Introduction following this Preface, the author has
summarized the general lesson to be derived from the course
of this War of American Independence, as distinct from the
particular discussion and narration of the several events
which constitute the body of the treatment. These lessons
he conceives to carry admonition for the present and future
based upon the surest foundations; namely, upon the experience
of the past as applicable to present conditions. The
essential similarity between the two is evident in a common
dependence upon naval strength.</p>

<p>There has been a careful rereading and revision of the
whole text; but the changes found necessary to be made are
much fewer than might have been anticipated after the
lapse of fifteen years. Numerous footnotes in the History,
specifying the names of ships in fleets, and of their commanders
in various battles, have been omitted, as not necessary
to the present purpose, though eminently proper and
indeed indispensable to an extensive work of general reference
and of encyclopædic scope, such as the History is.
Certain notes retained with the initials W.L.C. are due to
the editor of that work.</p>

<h1>The Major Operations of the Navies in the War of American Independence</h1>




<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>THE TENDENCY OF WARS TO SPREAD</h3>


<p>Macaulay, in a striking passage of his Essay
on Frederick the Great, wrote, "The evils
produced by his wickedness were felt in lands
where the name of Prussia was unknown.
In order that he might rob a neighbour whom he had promised
to defend, black men fought on the coast of Coromandel, and
red men scalped each other by the Great Lakes of North America."</p>

<p>Wars, like conflagrations, tend to spread; more than
ever perhaps in these days of close international entanglements
and rapid communications. Hence the anxiety
aroused and the care exercised by the governments of Europe,
the most closely associated and the most sensitive on the
earth, to forestall the kindling of even the slightest flame in
regions where all alike are interested, though with diverse
objects; regions such as the Balkan group of States in their
exasperating relations with the Turkish empire, under
which the Balkan peoples see constantly the bitter oppression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>
of men of their own blood and religious faith by the
tyranny of a government which can neither assimilate nor
protect. The condition of Turkish European provinces is
a perpetual lesson to those disposed to ignore or to depreciate
the immense difficulties of administering politically, under
one government, peoples traditionally and racially distinct,
yet living side by side; not that the situation is much better
anywhere in the Turkish empire. This still survives, though
in an advanced state of decay, simply because other States
are not prepared to encounter the risks of a disturbance
which might end in a general bonfire, extending its ravages
to districts very far remote from the scene of the original trouble.</p>

<p>Since these words were written, actual war has broken out
in the Balkans. The Powers, anxious each as to the effect
upon its own ambitions of any disturbance in European
Turkey, have steadily abstained from efficient interference
in behalf of the downtrodden Christians of Macedonia,
surrounded by sympathetic kinsfolk. Consequently, in
thirty years past this underbrush has grown drier and drier,
fit kindling for fuel. In the Treaty of Berlin, in 1877, stipulation
was made for their betterment in governance, and we
are now told that in 1880 Turkey framed a scheme for such,&mdash;and
pigeonholed it. At last, under unendurable conditions,
spontaneous combustion has followed. There can be
no assured peace until it is recognised practically that Christianity,
by the respect which it alone among religions inculcates
for the welfare of the individual, is an essential factor
in developing in nations the faculty of self-government, apart
from which fitness to govern others does not exist. To keep
Christian peoples under the rule of a non-Christian race, is,
therefore, to perpetuate a state hopeless of reconcilement
and pregnant of sure explosion. Explosions always happen
inconveniently. <i>Obsta principiis</i> is the only safe rule; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>
application of which is not suppression of overt discontent
but relief of grievances.</p>

<p>The War of American Independence was no exception to
the general rule of propagation that has been noted. When
our forefathers began to agitate against the Stamp Act
and the other measures that succeeded it, they as little foresaw
the spread of their action to the East and West Indies, to
the English Channel and Gibraltar, as did the British
ministry which in framing the Stamp Act struck the match
from which these consequences followed. When Benedict
Arnold on Lake Champlain by vigorous use of small means
obtained a year's delay for the colonists, he compassed the
surrender of Burgoyne in 1777. The surrender of Burgoyne,
justly estimated as the decisive event of the war, was due to
Arnold's previous action, gaining the delay which is a first
object for all defence, and which to the unprepared colonists
was a vital necessity. The surrender of Burgoyne determined
the intervention of France, in 1778; the intervention of
France the accession of Spain thereto, in 1779. The war
with these two Powers led to the maritime occurrences, the
interferences with neutral trade, that gave rise to the Armed
Neutrality; the concurrence of Holland in which brought
war between that country and Great Britain, in 1780. This
extension of hostilities affected not only the West Indies but
the East, through the possessions of the Dutch in both
quarters and at the Cape of Good Hope. If not the occasion
of Suffren being sent to India, the involvement of Holland
in the general war had a powerful effect upon the brilliant
operations which he conducted there; as well as at, and for,
the Cape of Good Hope, then a Dutch possession, on his outward voyage.</p>

<p>In the separate publication of these pages, my intention
and hope are to bring home incidentally to American readers
this vast extent of the struggle to which our own Declaration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>
of Independence was but the prelude; with perchance the
further needed lesson for the future, that questions the
most remote from our own shores may involve us in unforeseen
difficulties, especially if we permit a train of communication
to be laid by which the outside fire can leap step by step
to the American continents. How great a matter a little fire
kindleth! Our Monroe Doctrine is in final analysis merely
the formulation of national precaution that, as far as in its
power to prevent, there shall not lie scattered about the
material which foreign possessions in these continents
might supply for the extension of combustion originating
elsewhere; and the objection to Asiatic immigration, however
debased by less worthy feelings or motives, is on the part
of thinking men simply a recognition of the same danger
arising from the presence of an inassimilable mass of population,
racially and traditionally distinct in characteristics,
behind which would lie the sympathies and energy of a powerful
military and naval Asiatic empire.</p>

<p>Conducive as each of these policies is to national safety
and peace amid international conflagration, neither the one
nor the other can be sustained without the creation and
maintenance of a preponderant navy. In the struggle
with which this book deals, Washington at the time said that
the navies had the casting vote. To Arnold on Lake Champlain,
to DeGrasse at Yorktown, fell the privilege of exercising
that prerogative at the two great decisive moments of
the War. To the Navy also, beyond any other single instrumentality,
was due eighty years later the successful suppression
of the movement of Secession. The effect of the blockade
of the Southern coasts upon the financial and military
efficiency of the Confederate Government has never been
closely calculated, and probably is incalculable. At these
two principal national epochs control of the water was the
most determinative factor. In the future, upon the Navy will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>
depend the successful maintenance of the two leading national
policies mentioned; the two most essential to the part this
country is to play in the progress of the world.</p>

<p>For, while numerically great in population, the United
States is not so in proportion to territory; nor, though
wealthy, is she so in proportion to her exposure. That
Japan at four thousand miles distance has a population of
over three hundred to the square mile, while our three great
Pacific States average less than twenty, is a portentous fact.
The immense aggregate numbers resident elsewhere in the
United States cannot be transfered thither to meet an emergency,
nor contribute effectively to remedy this insufficiency;
neither can a land force on the defensive protect, if the way
of the sea is open. In such opposition of smaller numbers
against larger, nowhere do organisation and development
count as much as in navies. Nowhere so well as on the sea
can a general numerical inferiority be compensated by
specific numerical superiority, resulting from the correspondence
between the force employed and the nature of the ground.
It follows strictly, by logic and by inference, that by no other
means can safety be insured as economically and as efficiently.
Indeed, in matters of national security, economy
and efficiency are equivalent terms. The question of the
Pacific is probably the greatest world problem of the twentieth
century, in which no great country is so largely and directly
interested as is the United States. For the reason given it is
essentially a naval question, the third in which the United
States finds its well-being staked upon naval adequacy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE NAVAL CAMPAIGN ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN<br />
1775-1776</h3>


<p>At the time when hostilities began between Great
Britain and her American Colonies, the fact was
realised generally, being evident to reason and
taught by experience, that control of the water,
both ocean and inland, would have a preponderant effect
upon the contest. It was clear to reason, for there was a
long seaboard with numerous interior navigable watercourses,
and at the same time scanty and indifferent communications
by land. Critical portions of the territory involved were
yet an unimproved wilderness. Experience, the rude but
efficient schoolmaster of that large portion of mankind which
gains knowledge only by hard knocks, had confirmed through
the preceding French wars the inferences of the thoughtful.
Therefore, conscious of the great superiority of the British
Navy, which, however, had not then attained the unchallenged
supremacy of a later day, the American leaders early
sought the alliance of the Bourbon kingdoms, France and
Spain, the hereditary enemies of Great Britain. There
alone could be found the counterpoise to a power which, if
unchecked, must ultimately prevail.</p>

<p>Nearly three years elapsed before the Colonists accomplished
this object, by giving a demonstration of their strength
in the enforced surrender of Burgoyne's army at Saratoga.
This event has merited the epithet "decisive," because, and
only because, it decided the intervention of France. It may
be affirmed, with little hesitation, that this victory of the
colonists was directly the result of naval force,&mdash;that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>
the colonists themselves. It was the cause that naval force
from abroad, entering into the contest, transformed it from
a local to a universal war, and assured the independence of the
Colonies. That the Americans were strong enough to impose
the capitulation of Saratoga, was due to the invaluable
year of delay secured to them by their little navy on Lake
Champlain, created by the indomitable energy, and handled
with the indomitable courage, of the traitor, Benedict
Arnold. That the war spread from America to Europe,
from the English Channel to the Baltic, from the Bay of
Biscay to the Mediterranean, from the West Indies to the
Mississippi, and ultimately involved the waters of the remote
peninsula of Hindustan, is traceable, through Saratoga, to
the rude flotilla which in 1776 anticipated its enemy in the
possession of Lake Champlain. The events which thus culminated
merit therefore a clearer understanding, and a fuller
treatment, than their intrinsic importance and petty scale
would justify otherwise.</p>

<p>In 1775, only fifteen years had elapsed since the expulsion
of the French from the North American continent. The
concentration of their power, during its continuance, in the
valley of the St. Lawrence, had given direction to the local
conflict, and had impressed upon men's minds the importance
of Lake Champlain, of its tributary Lake George, and of the
Hudson River, as forming a consecutive, though not continuous,
water line of communications from the St. Lawrence
to New York. The strength of Canada against attack
by land lay in its remoteness, in the wilderness to be traversed
before it was reached, and in the strength of the line of the
St. Lawrence, with the fortified posts of Montreal and
Quebec on its northern bank. The wilderness, it is true,
interposed its passive resistance to attacks from Canada
as well as to attacks upon it; but when it had been traversed,
there were to the southward no such strong natural positions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>
confronting the assailant. Attacks from the south fell upon
the front, or at best upon the flank, of the line of the St.
Lawrence. Attacks from Canada took New York and its dependencies in the rear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/8.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/8.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Lake Champlain and Connected Waters</div>

<p>These elements of natural strength, in the military conditions
of the North, were impressed upon the minds of the
Americans by the prolonged resistance of Canada to the greatly
superior numbers of the British Colonists in the previous
wars. Regarded, therefore, as a base for attacks, of a kind
with which they were painfully familiar, but to be undergone
now under disadvantages of numbers and power never
before experienced, it was desirable to gain possession of
the St. Lawrence and its posts before they were strengthened
and garrisoned. At this outset of hostilities, the American
insurgents, knowing clearly their own minds, possessed
the advantage of the initiative over the British government,
which still hesitated to use against those whom it styled
rebels the preventive measures it would have taken at once
against a recognised enemy.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, in May, 1775, a body of two
hundred and seventy Americans, led by Ethan Allen and
Benedict Arnold, seized the posts of Ticonderoga and Crown
Point, which were inadequately garrisoned. These are on
the upper waters of Lake Champlain, where it is less than a
third of a mile wide; Ticonderoga being on a peninsula
formed by the lake and the inlet from Lake George, Crown
Point on a promontory twelve miles lower down.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> They
were positions of recognised importance, and had been advanced
posts of the British in previous wars. A schooner
being found there, Arnold, who had been a seaman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
embarked in her and hurried to the foot of the lake. The
wind failed him when still thirty miles from St. John's,
another fortified post on the lower narrows, where the lake
gradually tapers down to the Richelieu River, its outlet
to the St. Lawrence. Unable to advance otherwise, Arnold
took to his boats with thirty men, pulled through the night,
and at six o'clock on the following morning surprised the
post, in which were only a sergeant and a dozen men. He
reaped the rewards of celerity. The prisoners informed
him that a considerable body of troops was expected from
Canada, on its way to Ticonderoga; and this force in fact
reached St. John's on the next day. When it arrived, Arnold
was gone, having carried off a sloop which he found there and
destroyed everything else that could float. By such trifling
means two active officers had secured the temporary control
of the lake itself and of the approaches to it from the south.
There being no roads, the British, debarred from the water
line, were unable to advance. Sir Guy Carleton, Governor
and Commander-in-Chief in Canada, strengthened the works
at St. John's, and built a schooner; but his force was inadequate
to meet that of the Americans.</p>

<p>The seizure of the two posts, being an act of offensive war,
was not at once pleasing to the American Congress, which
still clung to the hope of reconciliation; but events were
marching rapidly, and ere summer was over the invasion of
Canada was ordered. General Montgomery, appointed to
that enterprise, embarked at Crown Point with two thousand
men on September 4th, and soon afterwards appeared
before St. John's, which after prolonged operations capitulated
on the 3d of November. On the 13th Montgomery
entered Montreal, and thence pressed down the St. Lawrence
to Pointe aux Trembles, twenty miles above Quebec. There
he joined Arnold, who in the month of October had crossed
the northern wilderness, between the head waters of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
Kennebec River and St. Lawrence. On the way he had
endured immense privations, losing five hundred men of the
twelve hundred with whom he started; and upon arriving
opposite Quebec, on the 10th of November, three days had
been unavoidably spent in collecting boats to pass the river.
Crossing on the night of the 13th, this adventurous soldier
and his little command climbed the Heights of Abraham by
the same path that had served Wolfe so well sixteen years
before. With characteristic audacity he summoned the
place. The demand of course was refused; but that Carleton
did not fall at once upon the little band of seven hundred that
bearded him shows by how feeble a tenure Great Britain
then held Canada. Immediately after the junction Montgomery
advanced on Quebec, where he appeared on the 5th
of December. Winter having already begun, and neither
his numbers nor his equipments being adequate to regular
siege operations, he very properly decided to try the desperate
chance of an assault upon the strongest fortress in
America. This was made on the night of December 31st,
1775. Whatever possibility of success there may have been
vanished with the death of Montgomery, who fell at the head of his men.</p>

<p>The American army retired three miles up the river, went
into winter-quarters, and established a land blockade of
Quebec, which was cut off from the sea by the ice. "For
five months," wrote Carleton to the Secretary for War, on
the 14th of May, 1776, "this town has been closely invested
by the rebels." From this unpleasant position it was relieved
on the 6th of May, when signals were exchanged
between it and the <i>Surprise</i>, the advance ship of a squadron
under Captain Charles Douglas,<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> which had sailed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
England on the 11th of March. Arriving off the mouth of the
St. Lawrence, on the morning of April 12th, Douglas found
ice extending nearly twenty miles to sea, and packed too
closely to admit of working through it by dexterous steering.
The urgency of the case not admitting delay, he ran his ship,
the <i>Isis</i>, 50, with a speed of five knots, against a large piece
of ice about ten or twelve feet thick, to test the effect. The
ice, probably softened by salt water and salt air, went to
pieces. "Encouraged by this experiment," continues Douglas,
somewhat magnificently, "we thought it an enterprise
worthy an English ship of the line in our King and country's
sacred cause, and an effort due to the gallant defenders of Quebec,
to make the attempt of pressing her by force of sail,
through the thick, broad, and closely connected fields of ice,
to which we saw no bounds towards the western part of our
horizon. Before night (when blowing a snow-storm, we
brought-to, or rather stopped), we had penetrated about
eight leagues into it, describing our path all the way with
bits of the sheathing of the ship's bottom, and sometimes
pieces of the cutwater, but none of the oak plank; and it was
pleasant enough at times, when we stuck fast, to see Lord
Petersham exercising his troops on the crusted surface of that
fluid through which the ship had so recently sailed." It
took nine days of this work to reach Anticosti Island, after
which the ice seems to have given no more trouble; but
further delay was occasioned by fogs, calms, and head winds.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the ships of war, the Americans at
once retreated. During the winter, though reinforcements
must have been received from time to time, they had wasted
from exposure, and from small-pox, which ravaged the camp.
On the 1st of May the returns showed nineteen hundred
men present, of whom only a thousand were fit for duty.
There were then on hand but three days' provisions, and none
other nearer than St. John's. The inhabitants would of course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
render no further assistance to the Americans after the ships
arrived. The Navy had again decided the fate of Canada,
and was soon also to determine that of Lake Champlain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/12.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/12.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>When two hundred troops had landed from the ships,
Carleton marched out, "to see," he said, "what these mighty
boasters were about." The sneer was unworthy a man of
his generous character, for the boasters had endured much for
faint chances of success; and the smallness of the reinforcement
which encouraged him to act shows either an extreme
prudence on his part, or the narrow margin by which Quebec
escaped. He found the enemy busy with preparations for
retreat, and upon his appearance they abandoned their camp.
Their forces on the two sides of the river being now separated
by the enemy's shipping, the Americans retired first to Sorel,
where the Richelieu enters the St. Lawrence, and thence
continued to fall back by gradual stages. It was not until
June 15th that Arnold quitted Montreal; and at the end of
June the united force was still on the Canadian side of the
present border line. On the 3d of July it reached Crown
Point, in a pitiable state from small-pox and destitution.</p>

<p>Both parties began at once to prepare for a contest upon
Lake Champlain. The Americans, small as their flotilla
was, still kept the superiority obtained for them by Arnold's
promptitude a year before. On the 25th of June the American
General Schuyler, commanding the Northern Department,
wrote: "We have happily such a naval superiority on Lake
Champlain, that I have a confident hope the enemy will not
appear upon it this campaign, especially as our force is
increasing by the addition of gondolas, two nearly finished.
Arnold, however,"&mdash;whose technical knowledge caused
him to be intrusted with the naval preparations,&mdash;"says
that 300 carpenters should be employed and a large number
of gondolas, row-galleys, etc., be built, twenty or thirty at
least. There is great difficulty in getting the carpenters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
needed." Arnold's ideas were indeed on a scale worthy
of the momentous issues at stake. "To augment our navy
on the lake appears to me of the utmost importance. There
is water between Crown Point and Pointe au Fer for vessels
of the largest size. I am of opinion that row-galleys are the
best construction and cheapest for this lake. Perhaps it
may be well to have one frigate of 36 guns. She may carry
18-pounders on the Lake, and be superior to any vessel
that can be built or floated from St. John's."</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Americans, their resources in men
and means were far inferior to those of their opponents,
who were able eventually to carry out, though on a somewhat
smaller scale, Arnold's idea of a sailing ship, strictly so called,
of force as yet unknown in inland waters. Such a ship, aided
as she was by two consorts of somewhat similar character,
dominated the Lake as soon as she was afloat, reversing
all the conditions. To place and equip her, however, required
time, invaluable time, during which Arnold's two schooners
exercised control. Baron Riedesel, the commander of the
German contingent with Carleton, after examining the American
position at Ticonderoga, wrote, "If we could have begun
our expedition four weeks earlier, I am satisfied that everything
would have been ended this year (1776); but, not
having shelter nor other necessary things, we were unable
to remain at the other [southern] end of Champlain." So
delay favors the defence, and changes issues. What would
have been the effect upon the American cause if, simultaneously
with the loss of New York, August 20th-September
15th, had come news of the fall of Ticonderoga, the repute
of which for strength stood high? Nor was this all; for in
that event, the plan which was wrecked in 1777 by Sir
William Howe's ill-conceived expedition to the Chesapeake
would doubtless have been carried out in 1776. In a contemporary
English paper occurs the following significant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
item: "London, September 26th, 1776. Advices have been
received here from Canada, dated August 12th, that General
Burgoyne's army has found it impracticable to get across
the lakes this season. The naval force of the Provincials
is too great for them to contend with at present. They
must build larger vessels for this purpose, and these cannot
be ready before next summer. The design <i>was</i><a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> that the two
armies commanded by Generals Howe and Burgoyne should
co&#246;perate; that they should both be on the Hudson River
at the same time; that they should join about Albany, and
thereby cut off all communication between the northern and
southern Colonies."<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>As Arnold's more ambitious scheme could not be realised,
he had to content himself with gondolas and galleys, for the
force he was to command as well as to build. The precise
difference between the two kinds of rowing vessels thus distinguished
by name, the writer has not been able to ascertain.
The gondola was a flat-bottomed boat, and inferior in nautical
qualities&mdash;speed, handiness, and seaworthiness&mdash;to the
galleys, which probably were keeled. The latter certainly
carried sails, and may have been capable of beating to windward.
Arnold preferred them, and stopped the building of
gondolas. "The galleys," he wrote, "are quick moving,
which will give us a great advantage in the open lake." The
complements of the galleys were eighty men, of the gondolas
forty-five; from which, and from their batteries, it may be
inferred that the latter were between one third and one half
the size of the former. The armaments of the two were alike
in character, but those of the gondolas much lighter. American
accounts agree with Captain Douglas's report of one
galley captured by the British. In the bows, an 18 and a
12-pounder; in the stern, two 9's; in broadside, from four to
six 6's. There is in this a somewhat droll reminder of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
disputed merits of bow, stern, and broadside fire, in a modern
iron-clad; and the practical conclusion is much the same.
The gondolas had one 12-pounder and two 6's. All the
vessels of both parties carried a number of swivel guns.</p>

<p>Amid the many difficulties which lack of resources imposed
upon all American undertakings, Arnold succeeded in getting
afloat with three schooners, a sloop, and five gondolas, on
the 20th of August. He cruised at the upper end of Champlain
till the 1st of September, when he moved rapidly north,
and on the 3d anchored in the lower narrows, twenty-five
miles above St. John's, stretching his line from shore to shore.
Scouts had kept him informed of the progress of the British
naval preparations, so that he knew that there was no immediate
danger; while an advanced position, maintained with a
bold front, would certainly prevent reconnoissances by
water, and possibly might impose somewhat upon the
enemy. The latter, however, erected batteries on each
side of the anchorage, compelling Arnold to fall back to the
broader lake. He then had soundings taken about Valcour
Island, and between it and the western shore; that being
the position in which he intended to make a stand. He
retired thither on the 23rd of September.</p>

<p>The British on their side had contended with no less
obstacles than their adversaries, though of a somewhat
different character. To get carpenters and materials to
build, and seamen to man, were the chief difficulties of the
Americans, the necessities of the seaboard conceding but
partially the demands made upon it; but their vessels were
built upon the shores of the Lake, and launched into navigable
waters. A large fleet of transports and ships of war in the St.
Lawrence supplied the British with adequate resources, which
were utilized judiciously and energetically by Captain
Douglas; but to get these to the Lake was a long and arduous
task. A great part of the Richelieu River was shoal, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>
obstructed by rapids. The point where lake navigation began
was at St. John's, to which the nearest approach, by a
hundred-ton schooner, from the St. Lawrence, was Chambly,
ten miles below. Flat-boats and long-boats could be dragged
up stream, but vessels of any size had to be transported by
land; and the engineers found the roadbed too soft in places
to bear the weight of a hundred tons. Under Douglas's
directions, the planking and frames of two schooners were
taken down at Chambly, and carried round by road to St.
John's, where they were again put together. At Quebec he
found building a new hull, of one hundred and eighty tons.
This he took apart nearly to the keel, shipping the frames
in thirty long-boats, which the transport captains consented
to surrender, together with their carpenters, for service on
the Lake. Drafts from the ships of war, and volunteers from
the transports, furnished a body of seven hundred seamen
for the same employment,&mdash;a force to which the Americans
could oppose nothing equal, commanded as it was by regular
naval officers. The largest vessel was ship-rigged, and had a
battery of eighteen 12-pounders; she was called the <i>Inflexible</i>,
and was commanded by Lieutenant John Schanck. The
two schooners, <i>Maria</i>, Lieutenant Starke, and <i>Carleton</i>,
Lieutenant James Richard Dacres, carried respectively fourteen
and twelve 6-pounders. These were the backbone
of the British flotilla. There were also a radeau, the <i>Thunderer</i>,
and a large gondola, the <i>Loyal Convert</i>, both heavily
armed; but, being equally heavy of movement, they do not
appear to have played any important part. Besides these,
when the expedition started, there were twenty gunboats,
each carrying one fieldpiece, from 24's to 9-pounders; or, in
some cases, howitzers.<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>

<p>"By all these means," wrote Douglas on July 21st, "our
acquiring an absolute dominion over Lake Champlain is not
doubted of." The expectation was perfectly sound. With
a working breeze, the <i>Inflexible</i> alone could sweep the Lake
clear of all that floated on it. But the element of time remained.
From the day of this writing till that on which
he saw the <i>Inflexible</i> leave St. John's, October 4th, was over
ten weeks; and it was not until the 9th that Carleton was
ready to advance with the squadron. By that time the
American troops at the head of the Lake had increased to
eight or ten thousand. The British land force is reported<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
as thirteen thousand, of which six thousand were in garrison
at St. John's and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Arnold's last reinforcements reached him at Valcour on
the 6th of October. On that day, and in the action of the
11th, he had with him all the American vessels on the Lake,
except one schooner and one galley. His force, thus, was two
schooners and a sloop, broadside vessels, besides four galleys
and eight gondolas, which may be assumed reasonably to
have depended on their bow guns; there, at least, was their
heaviest fire. Thus reckoned, his flotilla, disposed to the
best advantage, could bring into action at one time, two 18's,
thirteen 12's, one 9, two 6's, twelve 4's, and two 2-pounders,
independent of swivels; total thirty-two guns, out of eighty-four
that were mounted in fifteen vessels. To this the British
had to oppose, in three broadside vessels, nine 12's and thirteen
6's, and in twenty gunboats, twenty other brass guns,
"from twenty-four to nines, some with howitzers;"<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> total
forty-two guns. In this statement the radeau and gondola
have not been included, because of their unmanageableness.
Included as broadside vessels, they would raise the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
armament&mdash;by three 24's, three 12's, four 9's, and a
howitzer&mdash;to a total of fifty-three guns. Actually, they
could be brought into action only under exceptional circumstances,
and are more properly omitted.</p>

<p>These minutiæ are necessary for the proper appreciation
of what Captain Douglas justly called "a momentous event."
It was a strife of pigmies for the prize of a continent, and
the leaders are entitled to full credit both for their antecedent
energy and for their dispositions in the contest; not least the
unhappy man who, having done so much to save his country,
afterwards blasted his name by a treason unsurpassed in
modern war. Energy and audacity had so far preserved
the Lake to the Americans; Arnold determined to have
one more try of the chances. He did not know the full
force of the enemy, but he expected that "it would be very
formidable, if not equal to ours."<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> The season, however,
was so near its end that a severe check would equal a defeat,
and would postpone Carleton's further advance to the next
spring. Besides, what was the worth of such a force as the
American, such a flotilla, under the guns of Ticonderoga, the
Lake being lost? It was eminently a case for taking chances,
even if the detachment should be sacrificed, as it was.</p>

<p>Arnold's original purpose had been to fight under way;
and it was from this point of view that he valued the galleys,
because of their mobility. It is uncertain when he first
learned of the rig and battery of the <i>Inflexible</i>; but a good
look-out was kept, and the British squadron was sighted
from Valcour when it quitted the narrows. It may have
been seen even earlier; for Carleton had been informed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
erroneously, that the Americans were near Grand Island,
which led him to incline to that side, and so open out Valcour
sooner. The British anchored for the night of October
10th, between Grand and Long<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> Islands. Getting under way
next morning, they stood up the Lake with a strong north-east
wind, keeping along Grand Island, upon which their attention
doubtless was fastened by the intelligence which they had
received; but it was a singular negligence thus to run to leeward
with a fair wind, without thorough scouting on both
hands. The consequence was that the American flotilla
was not discovered until Valcour Island, which is from one
hundred and twenty to one hundred and eighty feet high
throughout its two miles of length, was so far passed that the
attack had to be made from the south,&mdash;from leeward.</p>

<p>When the British were first made out, Arnold's second
in command, Waterbury, urged that in view of the
enemy's superiority the flotilla should get under way at
once, and fight them "on a retreat in the main lake;"
the harbour being disadvantageous "to fight a number
so much superior, and the enemy being able to surround
us on every side, we lying between an island and the
main." Waterbury's advice evidently found its origin in
that fruitful source of military errors of design, which reckons
the preservation of a force first of objects, making the results
of its action secondary. With sounder judgment,
Arnold decided to hold on. A retreat before square-rigged
sailing vessels having a fair wind, by a heterogeneous force
like his own, of unequal speeds and batteries, could result
only in disaster. Concerted fire and successful escape were
alike improbable; and besides, escape, if feasible, was but
throwing up the game. Better trust to a steady, well-ordered
position, developing the utmost fire. If the enemy
discovered him, and came in by the northern entrance, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
was a five-foot knoll in mid-channel which might fetch the
biggest of them up; if, as proved to be the case, the island
should be passed, and the attack should be made from leeward,
it probably would be partial and in disorder, as also happened.
The correctness of Arnold's decision not to chance a retreat
was shown in the retreat of two days later.</p>

<p>Valcour is on the west side of the Lake, about three quarters
of a mile from the main; but a peninsula projecting from the
island at mid-length narrows this interval to a half-mile.
From the accounts, it is clear that the American flotilla lay
south of this peninsula. Arnold therefore had a reasonable
hope that it might be passed undetected. Writing to Gates,
the Commander-in-Chief at Ticonderoga, he said: "There is
a good harbour, and if the enemy venture up the Lake it will
be impossible for them to take advantage of our situation. If
we succeed in our attack upon them, it will be impossible for
any to escape. If we are worsted, our retreat is open and
free. In case of wind, which generally blows fresh at this
season, our craft will make good weather, while theirs cannot
keep the Lake." It is apparent from this, written three
weeks before the battle, that he then was not expecting
a force materially different from his own. Later, he describes
his position as being "in a small bay on the west
side of the island, as near together as possible, and in such a
form that few vessels can attack us at the same time, and
those will be exposed to the fire of the whole fleet."
Though he unfortunately gives no details, he evidently had
sound tactical ideas. The formation of the anchored vessels
is described by the British officers as a half-moon.</p>

<p>When the British discovered the enemy, they hauled up
for them. Arnold ordered one of his schooners, the <i>Royal
Savage</i>, and the four galleys, to get under way; the two
other schooners and the eight gondolas remaining at their
anchors. The <i>Royal Savage</i>, dropping to leeward,&mdash;by bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
management, Arnold says,&mdash;came, apparently unsupported,
under the distant fire of the <i>Inflexible</i>, as she drew under the
lee of Valcour at 11 A.M., followed by the <i>Carleton</i>, and at
greater distance by the <i>Maria</i> and the gunboats. Three
shots from the ship's 12-pounders struck the <i>Royal Savage</i>,
which then ran ashore on the southern point of the island.
The <i>Inflexible</i>, followed closely by the <i>Carleton</i>, continued
on, but fired only occasionally; showing that Arnold
was keeping his galleys in hand, at long bowls,&mdash;as
small vessels with one eighteen should be kept, when confronted
with a broadside of nine guns. Between the island
and the main the north-east wind doubtless drew more
northerly, adverse to the ship's approach; but, a flaw off
the cliffs taking the fore and aft sails of the <i>Carleton</i>, she
fetched "nearly into the middle of the rebel half-moon, where
Lieutenant J.R. Dacres intrepidly anchored with a spring
on her cable." The <i>Maria</i>, on board which was Carleton,
together with Commander Thomas Pringle, commanding
the flotilla, was to leeward when the chase began, and could
not get into close action that day. By this time, seventeen
of the twenty gunboats had come up, and, after silencing
the <i>Royal Savage</i>, pulled up to within point-blank range
of the American flotilla. "The cannonade was tremendous,"
wrote Baron Riedesel. Lieutenant Edward Longcroft,
of the radeau <i>Thunderer</i>, not being able to get his raft
into action, went with a boat's crew on board the <i>Royal
Savage</i>, and for a time turned her guns upon her former
friends; but the fire of the latter forced him again to
abandon her, and it seemed so likely that she might be re-taken
that she was set on fire by Lieutenant Starke of the
<i>Maria</i>, when already "two rebel boats were very near her.
She soon after blew up." The American guns converging on
the <i>Carleton</i> in her central position, she suffered severely.
Her commander, Lieutenant Dacres, was knocked senseless;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>
another officer lost an arm; only Mr. Edward Pellew, afterwards
Lord Exmouth, remained fit for duty. The spring
being shot away, she swung bows on to the enemy, and her
fire was thus silenced. Captain Pringle signalled to her to
withdraw; but she was unable to obey. To pay her head
off the right way, Pellew himself had to get out on the bowsprit
under a heavy fire of musketry, to bear the jib over to
windward; but to make sail seems to have been impossible.
Two artillery boats were sent to her assistance, "which towed
her off through a very thick fire, until out of farther reach,
much to the honour of Mr. John Curling and Mr. Patrick
Carnegy, master's mate and midshipman of the <i>Isis</i>, who
conducted them; and of Mr. Edward Pellew, mate of the
<i>Blonde</i>, who threw the tow-rope from the <i>Carleton's</i> bowsprit."<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>
This service on board the <i>Carleton</i> started Pellew on
his road to fortune; but, singularly enough, the lieutenancy
promised him in consequence, by both the First Lord and
Lord Howe, was delayed by the fact that he stayed at the
front, instead of going to the rear, where he would have been
"within their jurisdiction."<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a> The <i>Carleton</i> had two feet of
water in the hold, and had lost eight killed and six wounded,&mdash;about
half her crew,&mdash;when she anchored out of fire.
In this small but stirring business, the Americans, in addition
to the <i>Royal Savage</i>, had lost one gondola. Besides the injuries
to the <i>Carleton</i>, a British artillery boat, commanded by a
German lieutenant, was sunk. Towards evening the <i>Inflexible</i>
got within point-blank shot of the Americans, "when
five broadsides," wrote Douglas, "silenced their whole line."
One fresh ship, with scantling for sea-going, and a concentrated
battery, has an unquestioned advantage over a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>
dozen light-built craft, carrying one or two guns each, and
already several hours engaged.</p>

<p>At nightfall the <i>Inflexible</i> dropped out of range, and the
British squadron anchored in line of battle across the southern
end of the passage between the island and the main; some
vessels were extended also to the eastward, into the open
Lake. "The best part of my intelligence," wrote Burgoyne
next day from St. John's, to Douglas at Quebec, "is that our
whole fleet was formed in line above the enemy, and consequently
they must have surrendered this morning, or given
us battle on our own terms. The Indians and light troops
are abreast with the fleet; they cannot, therefore, escape
by land." The British squadron sharing this confidence, a
proper look-out was not kept. The American leader immediately
held a conference with his officers, and decided to
attempt a retreat, "which was done with such secrecy,"
writes Waterbury, "that we went through them entirely
undiscovered." The movement began at 7 P.M., a galley
leading, the gondolas and schooners following, and Arnold
and his second bringing up the rear in the two heaviest
galleys. This delicate operation was favoured by a heavy fog,
which did not clear till next morning at eight. As the
Americans stole by, they could not see any of the hostile
ships. By daylight they were out of sight of the British.
Riedesel, speaking of this event, says, "The ships anchored,
secure of the enemy, who stole off during the night, and
sailing round the left wing, aided by a favourable wind, escaped
under darkness." The astonishment next morning,
he continues, was great, as was Carleton's rage. The latter
started to pursue in such a hurry that he forgot to leave orders
for the troops which had been landed; but, failing to discover
the fugitives, he returned and remained at Valcour till nightfall,
when scouts brought word that the enemy were at
Schuyler's Island, eight miles above.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>

<p>The retreat of the Americans had been embarrassed by
their injuries, and by the wind coming out ahead. They
were obliged to anchor on the 12th to repair damages, both
hulls and sails having suffered severely. Arnold took the
precaution to write to Crown Point for bateaux, to tow in
case of a southerly wind; but time did not allow these to
arrive. Two gondolas had to be sunk on account of their
injuries, making three of that class so far lost. The retreat
was resumed at 2 P.M., but the breeze was fresh from the
southward, and the gondolas made very little way. At
evening the British chased again. That night the wind
moderated, and at daybreak the American flotilla was twenty-eight
miles from Crown Point,&mdash;fourteen from Valcour,&mdash;having
still five miles' start. Later, however, by Arnold's report,
"the wind again breezed up to the southward, so that we
gained very little either by beating or rowing. At the same
time the enemy took a fresh breeze from northeast, and, by
the time we had reached Split Rock, were alongside of us."
The galleys of Arnold and Waterbury, the <i>Congress</i> and the
<i>Washington</i>, had throughout kept in the rear, and now
received the brunt of the attack, made by the <i>Inflexible</i> and
the two schooners, which had entirely distanced their sluggish
consorts. This fight was in the upper narrows, where the
Lake is from one to three miles wide; and it lasted, by Arnold's
report, for five glasses (two hours and a half),<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a> the
Americans continually retreating, until about ten miles from
Crown Point. There, the <i>Washington</i> having struck some
time before, and final escape being impossible, Arnold ran
the <i>Congress</i> and four gondolas ashore in a small creek on
the east side; pulling to windward, with the cool judgment
that had marked all his conduct, so that the enemy could
not follow him&mdash;except in small boats with which he could
deal. There he set his vessels on fire, and stood by them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>
until assured that they would blow up with their flags flying.
He then retreated to Crown Point through the woods,
"despite the savages;" a phrase which concludes this singular
aquatic contest with a quaint touch of local colour.</p>

<p>In three days of fighting and retreating the Americans had
lost one schooner, two galleys, and seven gondolas,&mdash;in all,
ten vessels out of fifteen. The killed and wounded amounted
to over eighty, twenty odd of whom were in Arnold's galley.
The original force, numbering seven hundred, had been
decimated. Considering its raw material and the recency of
its organisation, words can scarcely exaggerate the heroism
of the resistance, which undoubtedly depended chiefly
upon the personal military qualities of the leader. The
British loss in killed and wounded did not exceed forty.</p>

<p>The little American navy on Champlain was wiped out;
but never had any force, big or small, lived to better purpose
or died more gloriously, for it had saved the Lake for that
year. Whatever deductions may be made for blunders, and
for circumstances of every character which made the British
campaign of 1777 abortive and disastrous, thus leading
directly to the American alliance with France in 1778, the
delay, with all that it involved, was obtained by the Lake
campaign of 1776. On October 15th, two days after Arnold's
final defeat, Carleton dated a letter to Douglas from before
Crown Point, whence the American garrison was withdrawn.
A week later Riedesel arrived, and wrote that, "were our
whole army here it would be an easy matter to drive the
enemy from their entrenchments," at Ticonderoga, and&mdash;as
has been quoted already&mdash;four weeks sooner would have
insured its fall. It is but a coincidence that just four weeks
had been required to set up the <i>Inflexible</i> at St. John's;
but it typifies the whole story. Save for Arnold's flotilla,
the two British schooners would have settled the business.
"Upon the whole, Sir," wrote Douglas in his final letter from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>
Quebec before sailing for England, "I scruple not to say,
that had not General Carleton authorized me to take the
extraordinary measure of sending up the <i>Inflexible</i> from Quebec,
things could not this year have been brought to so glorious
a conclusion on Lake Champlain." Douglas further
showed the importance attached to this success by men of
that day, by sending a special message to the British
ambassador at Madrid, "presuming that the early
knowledge of this great event in the southern parts
of Europe may be of advantage to His Majesty's service."
That the opinion of the government was similar may be
inferred from the numerous rewards bestowed. Carleton
was made a Knight of the Bath, and Douglas a baronet.</p>

<p>The gallantry shown by both sides upon Lake Champlain
in 1776 is evident from the foregoing narrative. With
regard to the direction of movements,&mdash;the skill of the two
leaders,&mdash;the same equal credit cannot be assigned. It was
a very serious blunder, on October 11th, to run to leeward,
passing a concealed enemy, undetected, upon waters so perfectly
well known as those of Champlain were; it having been
the scene of frequent British operations in previous wars.
Owing to this, "the <i>Maria</i>, because of her distant situation
(from which the <i>Inflexible</i> and <i>Carleton</i> had chased by signal)
when the rebels were first discovered, and baffling winds,
could not get into close action."<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> For the same reason the
<i>Inflexible</i> could not support the <i>Carleton</i>. The Americans,
in the aggregate distinctly inferior, were thus permitted a
concentration of superior force upon part of their enemies.
It is needless to enlarge upon the mortifying incident of
Arnold's escape that evening. To liken small things to great,&mdash;always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
profitable in military analysis,&mdash;it resembled
Hood's slipping away from de Grasse at St. Kitts.<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/27.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/27.jpg" alt="Benedict Arnold" /></a>
Benedict Arnold</div>

<p>In conduct and courage, Arnold's behavior was excellent
throughout. Without enlarging upon the energy which
created the flotilla, and the breadth of view which suggested
preparations that he could not enforce, admiration is due to
his recognition of the fact&mdash;implicit in deed, if unexpressed
in word&mdash;that the one use of the Navy was to contest the
control of the water; to impose delay, even if it could not
secure ultimate victory. No words could say more clearly
than do his actions that, under the existing conditions, the
navy was useless, except as it contributed to that end;
valueless, if buried in port. Upon this rests the merit of his
bold advance into the lower narrows; upon this his choice of
the strong defensive position of Valcour; upon this his refusal
to retreat, as urged by Waterbury, when the full force
of the enemy was disclosed,&mdash;a decision justified, or rather,
illustrated, by the advantages which the accidents of the day
threw into his hands. His personal gallantry was conspicuous
there as at all times of his life. "His countrymen," said
a generous enemy of that day, "chiefly gloried in the dangerous
attention which he paid to a nice point of honour, in keeping
his flag flying, and not quitting his galley till she was in
flames, lest the enemy should have boarded, and struck it."
It is not the least of the injuries done to his nation in after
years, that he should have silenced this boast and effaced this
glorious record by so black an infamy.</p>

<p>With the destruction of the flotilla ends the naval story
of the Lakes during the War of the American Revolution.
Satisfied that it was too late to proceed against Ticonderoga
that year, Carleton withdrew to St. John's and went into
winter-quarters. The following year the enterprise was resumed
under General Burgoyne; but Sir William Howe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>
instead of co&#246;perating by an advance up the Hudson, which
was the plan of 1776, carried his army to Chesapeake Bay,
to act thence against Philadelphia. Burgoyne took Ticonderoga
and forced his way as far as Saratoga, sixty miles from
Ticonderoga and thirty from Albany, where Howe should
have met him. There he was brought to a stand by the
army which the Americans had collected, found himself
unable to advance or to retreat, and was forced to lay down
his arms on October 17th, 1777. The garrison left by him
at Ticonderoga and Crown Point retired to Canada, and the
posts were re-occupied by the Americans. No further
contest took place on the Lake, though the British vessels
remained in control of it, and showed themselves from time
to time up to 1781. With the outbreak of war between
Great Britain and France, in 1778, the scene of maritime
interest shifted to salt water, and there remained till the end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>NAVAL ACTION AT BOSTON, CHARLESTON, NEW
YORK, AND NARRAGANSETT BAY&mdash;ASSOCIATED LAND OPERATIONS UP TO THE BATTLE
OF TRENTON<br />

1776</h3>


<p>The opening conflict between Great Britain and
her North American Colonies teaches clearly
the necessity, too rarely recognised in practice,
that when a State has decided to use force,
the force provided should be adequate from the first.
This applies with equal weight to national policies when
it is the intention of the nation to maintain them at all
costs. The Monroe Doctrine for instance is such a
policy; but unless constant adequate preparation is
maintained also, the policy itself is but a vain form
of words. It is in preparation beforehand, chiefly if
not uniformly, that the United States has failed. It is
better to be much too strong than a little too weak. Seeing
the evident temper of the Massachusetts Colonists, force
would be needed to execute the Boston Port Bill and its
companion measures of 1774; for the Port Bill especially,
naval force. The supplies for 1775 granted only 18,000
seamen,&mdash;2000 less than for the previous year. For 1776,
28,000 seamen were voted, and the total appropriations rose
from £5,556,000 to £10,154,000; but it was then too late.
Boston was evacuated by the British army, 8000 strong
on the 17th of March, 1776; but already, for more than half
a year, the spreading spirit of revolt in the thirteen Colonies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>
had been encouraged by the sight of the British army cooped
up in the town, suffering from want of necessaries, while the
colonial army blockading it was able to maintain its position,
because ships laden with stores for the one were captured,
and the cargoes diverted to the use of the other. To secure
free and ample communications for one's self, and to interrupt
those of the opponent, are among the first requirements
of war. To carry out the measures of the British government
a naval force was needed, which not only should protect the
approach of its own transports to Boston Bay, but should
prevent access to all coast ports whence supplies could be
carried to the blockading army. So far from this, the
squadron was not equal, in either number or quality, to the
work to be done about Boston; and it was not until October,
1775, that the Admiral was authorized to capture colonial
merchant vessels, which therefore went and came unmolested,
outside of Boston, carrying often provisions which found their
way to Washington's army.</p>

<p>After evacuating Boston, General Howe retired to Halifax,
there to await the coming of reinforcements, both military
and naval, and of his brother, Vice-Admiral Lord Howe,
appointed to command the North American Station. General
Howe was commander-in-chief of the forces throughout the
territory extending from Nova Scotia to West Florida;
from Halifax to Pensacola. The first operation of the
campaign was to be the reduction of New York.</p>

<p>The British government, however, had several objects in
view, and permitted itself to be distracted from the single-minded
prosecution of one great undertaking to other subsidiary
operations, not always concentric. Whether the
control of the line of the Hudson and Lake Champlain ought
to have been sought through operations beginning at both
ends, is open to argument; the facts that the Americans were
back in Crown Point in the beginning of July, 1776, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>
Carleton's 13,000 men got no farther than St. John's that
year, suggest that the greater part of the latter force would
have been better employed in New York and New Jersey
than about Champlain. However that may be, the diversion
to the Carolinas of a third body, respectable in point
of numbers, is scarcely to be defended on military grounds.
The government was induced to it by the expectation of local
support from royalists. That there were many of these in
both Carolinas is certain; but while military operations must
take account of political conditions, the latter should not be
allowed to overbalance elementary principles of the military
art. It is said that General Howe disapproved of this ex-centric movement.</p>

<p>The force destined for the Southern coasts assembled at
Cork towards the end of 1775, and sailed thence in January,
1776. The troops were commanded by Lord Cornwallis,
the squadron by Nelson's early patron, Commodore Sir
Peter Parker, whose broad pennant was hoisted on board the
<i>Bristol</i>, 50. After a boisterous passage, the expedition arrived
in May off Cape Fear in North Carolina, where it was joined
by two thousand men under Sir Henry Clinton, Cornwallis's
senior, whom Howe by the government's orders had detached
to the southward in January. Upon Clinton's appearance,
the royalists in North Carolina had risen, headed by the
husband of Flora Macdonald, whose name thirty years before
had been associated romantically with the escape of the
young Pretender from Scotland. She had afterwards emigrated
to America. The rising, however, had been put down,
and Clinton had not thought it expedient to try a serious
invasion, in face of the large force assembled to resist him.
Upon Parker's coming, it was decided to make an attempt
upon Charleston, South Carolina. The fleet therefore sailed
from Cape Fear on the 1st of June, and on the 4th anchored off Charleston Bar.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>

<p>Charleston Harbour opens between two of the sea-islands
which fringe the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia. On
the north is Sullivan's Island, on the south James Island.
The bar of the main entrance was not abreast the mouth of
the port, but some distance south of it. Inside the bar, the
channel turned to the northward, and thence led near Sullivan's
Island, the southern end of which was therefore chosen
as the site of the rude fort hastily thrown up to meet this
attack, and afterwards called Fort Moultrie, from the
name of the commander. From these conditions, a southerly
wind was needed to bring ships into action. After sounding
and buoying the bar, the transports and frigates crossed on
the 7th and anchored inside; but as it was necessary to remove
some of the <i>Bristol's</i> guns, she could not follow until
the 10th. On the 9th Clinton had landed in person with
five hundred men, and by the 15th all the troops had disembarked
upon Long Island, next north of Sullivan's. It was
understood that the inlet between the two was fordable,
allowing the troops to co&#246;perate with the naval attack, by
diversion or otherwise; but this proved to be a mistake.
The passage was seven feet deep at low water, and there
were no means for crossing; consequently a small American
detachment in the scrub wood of the island sufficed to
check any movement in that quarter. The fighting therefore
was confined to the cannonading of the fort by the ships.</p>

<p>Circumstances not fully explained caused the attack to be
fixed for the 23d; an inopportune delay, during which
Americans were strengthening their still very imperfect
defences. On the 23d the wind was unfavourable. On the
25th the <i>Experiment</i>, 50, arrived, crossed the bar, and, after
taking in her guns again, was ready to join in the assault.
On the 27th, at 10 A.M., the ships got under way with a south-east
breeze, but this shifted soon afterwards to north-west,
and they had to anchor again, about a mile nearer to Sullivan's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>
Island. On the following day the wind served, and the attack was made.</p>

<p>In plan, Fort Moultrie was square, with a bastion at each
angle. In construction, the sides were palmetto logs, dovetailed
and bolted together, laid in parallel rows, sixteen
feet apart; the interspace being filled with sand. At the
time of the engagement, the south and west fronts were
finished; the other fronts were only seven feet high, but surmounted
by thick planks, to be tenable against escalade.
Thirty-one guns were in place, 18 and 9-pounders, of
which twenty-one were on the south face, commanding the
channel. Within was a traverse running east and west, protecting
the gunners from shots from the rear; but there was
no such cover against enfilading fire, in case an enemy's
ship passed the fort and anchored above it. "The general
opinion before the action," Moultrie says, "and especially
among sailors, was that two frigates would be sufficient to
knock the town about our ears, notwithstanding our batteries."
Parker may have shared this impression, and it may
account for his leisureliness. When the action began, the
garrison had but twenty-eight rounds for each of twenty-six
cannon, but this deficiency was unknown to the British.</p>

<p>Parker's plan was that the two 50's, <i>Bristol</i> and <i>Experiment</i>,
and two 28-gun frigates, the <i>Active</i> and the <i>Solebay</i>,
should engage the main front; while two frigates of the same
class, the <i>Actæon</i> and the <i>Syren</i>, with a 20-gun corvette, the
<i>Sphinx</i>, should pass the fort, anchoring to the westward, up-channel,
to protect the heavy vessels against fire-ships, as
well as to enfilade the principal American battery. The
main attack was to be further supported by a bomb-vessel,
the <i>Thunder</i>, accompanied by the armed transport <i>Friendship</i>,
which were to take station to the southeast of the east bastion
of the engaged front of the fort. The order to weigh was
given at 10.30 A.M., when the flood-tide had fairly made;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>
and at 11.15 the <i>Active</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, <i>Experiment</i>, and
<i>Solebay</i>,
anchored in line ahead, in the order named, the <i>Active</i> to
the eastward. These ships seem to have taken their places
skilfully without confusion, and their fire, which opened at
once, was rapid, well-sustained, and well-directed; but
their position suffered under the radical defect that, whether
from actual lack of water, or only from fear of grounding,
they were too far from the works to use grape effectively.
The sides of ships being much weaker than those of shore
works, while their guns were much more numerous, the
secret of success was to get near enough to beat down the
hostile fire by a multitude of projectiles. The bomb-vessel
<i>Thunder</i> anchored in the situation assigned her; but her
shells, though well aimed, were ineffective. "Most of them
fell within the fort," Moultrie reported, "but we had a morass
in the middle, which swallowed them instantly, and those
that fell in the sand were immediately buried." During
the action the mortar bed broke, disabling the piece.</p>

<p>Owing to the scarcity of ammunition in the fort, the
garrison had positive orders not to engage at ranges exceeding
four hundred yards. Four or five shots were thrown at
the <i>Active</i>, while still under sail, but with this exception the
fort kept silence until the ships anchored, at a distance
estimated by the Americans to be three hundred and fifty
yards. The word was then passed along the platform, "Mind
the Commodore; mind the two 50-gun ships,"&mdash;an order
which was strictly obeyed, as the losses show. The protection
of the work proved to be almost perfect,&mdash;a fact which
doubtless contributed to the coolness and precision of fire
vitally essential with such deficient resources. The texture of
the palmetto wood suffered the balls to sink smoothly into
it without splintering, so that the facing of the work held well.
At times, when three or four broadsides struck together, the
merlons shook so that Moultrie feared they would come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>
bodily in; but they withstood, and the small loss inflicted
was chiefly through the embrasures. The flagstaff being
shot away, falling outside into the ditch, a young sergeant,
named Jasper, distinguished himself by jumping after
it, fetching back and rehoisting the colours under a heavy fire.</p>

<p>In the squadron an equal gallantry was shown under
circumstances which made severe demands upon endurance.
Whatever Parker's estimate of the worth of the defences,
no trace of vain-confidence appears in his dispositions, which
were thorough and careful, as the execution of the main
attack was skilful and vigorous; but the ships' companies,
expecting an easy victory, had found themselves confronted
with a resistance and a punishment as severe as were endured
by the leading ships at Trafalgar, and far more prolonged.
Such conditions impose upon men's tenacity the additional
test of surprise and discomfiture. The <i>Experiment</i>, though
very small for a ship of the line, lost 23 killed and 56 wounded,
out of a total probably not much exceeding 300; while the
<i>Bristol</i>, having the spring shot away, swung with her head
to the southward and her stern to the fort, undergoing for
a long time a raking fire to which she could make little reply.
Three several attempts to replace the spring were made by
Mr. James Saumarez,&mdash;afterwards the distinguished admiral,
Lord de Saumarez, then a midshipman,&mdash;before the
ship was relieved from this grave disadvantage. Her loss
was 40 killed and 71 wounded; not a man escaping of those
stationed on the quarter-deck at the beginning of the action.
Among the injured was the Commodore himself, whose cool
heroism must have been singularly conspicuous, from the
notice it attracted in a service where such bearing was not
rare. At one time when the quarter-deck was cleared and he
stood alone upon the poop-ladder, Saumarez suggested to him
to come down; but he replied, smiling, "You want to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>
rid of me, do you?" and refused to move. The captain of
the ship, John Morris, was mortally wounded. With commendable
modesty Parker only reported himself as slightly
bruised; but deserters stated that for some days he needed
the assistance of two men to walk, and that his trousers had
been torn off him by shot or splinters. The loss in the other
ships was only one killed, 14 wounded. The Americans had 37 killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The three vessels assigned to enfilade the main front
of the fort did not get into position. They ran on the
middle ground, owing, Parker reported, to the ignorance of the
pilots. Two had fouled each other before striking. Having
taken the bottom on a rising tide, two floated in a few hours,
and retreated; but the third, the <i>Actæon</i>, 28, sticking fast, was
set on fire and abandoned by her officers. Before she blew
up, the Americans boarded her, securing her colours, bell,
and some other trophies. "Had these ships effected their
purpose," Moultrie reported, "they would have driven us from our guns."</p>

<p>The main division held its ground until long after nightfall,
firing much of the time, but stopping at intervals. After
two hours it had been noted that the fort replied very slowly,
which was attributed to its being overborne, instead of to the
real cause, the necessity for sparing ammunition. For the
same reason it was entirely silent from 3.30 P.M. to 6, when
fire was resumed from only two or three guns, whence Parker
surmised that the rest had been dismounted. The Americans
were restrained throughout the engagement by the fear of
exhausting entirely their scanty store.</p>

<p>"About 9 P.M.," Parker reported, "being very dark, great
part of our ammunition expended, the people fatigued, the
tide of ebb almost done, no prospect from the eastward (that
is, from the army), and no possibility of our being of any
further service, I ordered the ships to withdraw to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
former moorings." Besides the casualties among the crew,
and severe damage to the hull, the <i>Bristol's</i> mainmast, with
nine cannon-balls in it, had to be shortened, while the mizzen-mast
was condemned. The injury to the frigates was immaterial,
owing to the garrison's neglecting them.</p>

<p>The fight in Charleston Harbour, the first serious contest
in which ships took part in this war, resembles generically
the battle of Bunker's Hill, with which the regular land warfare
had opened a year before. Both illustrate the difficulty
and danger of a front attack, without cover, upon a fortified
position, and the advantage conferred even upon untrained
men, if naturally cool, resolute, and intelligent, not only by
the protection of a work, but also, it may be urged, by the
recognition of a tangible line up to which to hold, and to
abandon which means defeat, dishonour, and disaster. It
is much for untried men to recognise in their surroundings
something which gives the unity of a common purpose, and
thus the coherence which discipline imparts. Although
there was in Parker's dispositions nothing open to serious
criticism,&mdash;nothing that can be ascribed to undervaluing
his opponent,&mdash;and although, also, he had good reason to
expect from the army active co&#246;peration which he did not
get, it is probable that he was very much surprised, not only
at the tenacity of the Americans' resistance, but at the efficacy
of their fire. He felt, doubtless, the traditional and natural
distrust&mdash;and, for the most part, the justified distrust&mdash;with
which experience and practice regard inexperience.
Some seamen of American birth, who had been serving in
the <i>Bristol</i>, deserted after the fight. They reported that her
crew said, "We were told the Yankees would not stand
two fires, but we never saw better fellows;" and when the fire
of the fort slackened and some cried, "They have done fighting,"
others replied, "By God, we are glad of it, for we never
had such a drubbing in our lives." "All the common men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>
of the fleet spoke loudly in praise of the garrison,"&mdash;a
note of admiration so frequent in generous enemies that we
may be assured that it was echoed on the quarter-deck also.
They could afford it well, for there was no stain upon their
own record beyond the natural mortification of defeat;
no flinching under the severity of their losses, although a
number of their men were comparatively raw, volunteers
from the transports, whose crews had come forward almost
as one man when they knew that the complements of the
ships were short through sickness. Edmund Burke, a
friend to both sides, was justified in saying that "never did
British valour shine more conspicuously, nor did our ships
in an engagement of the same nature experience so serious
an encounter." There were several death-vacancies for
lieutenants; and, as the battle of Lake Champlain gave
Pellew his first commission, so did that of Charleston Harbour
give his to Saumarez, who was made lieutenant of the <i>Bristol</i>
by Parker. Two years later, when the ship had gone to
Jamaica, he was followed on her quarter-deck by Nelson
and Collingwood, who also received promotion in her from the same hand.</p>

<p>The attack on Fort Moultrie was not resumed. After
necessary repairs, the ships of war with the troops went to
New York, where they arrived on the 4th of August, and took
part in the operations for the reduction of that place under the
direction of the two Howes.</p>

<hr />

<p>The occupation of New York Harbour, and the capture of
the city were the most conspicuous British successes of the
summer and fall of 1776. While Parker and Clinton were
meeting with defeat at Charleston, and Arnold was hurrying
the preparation of his flotilla on Champlain, the two brothers,
General Sir William Howe and the Admiral, Lord Howe,
were arriving in New York Bay, invested not only with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>
powers proper to the commanders of great fleets and armies,
but also with authority as peace commissioners, to negotiate
an amicable arrangement with the revolted Colonies.</p>

<p>Sir William Howe had awaited for some time at Halifax
the arrival of the expected reinforcements, but wearying
at last he sailed thence on the 10th of June, 1776, with the
army then in hand. On the 25th he himself reached Sandy
Hook, the entrance to New York Bay, having preceded the
transports in a frigate. On the 29th, the day after Parker's
repulse at Fort Moultrie, the troops arrived; and on July
3d, the date on which Arnold, retreating from Canada,
reached Crown Point, the British landed on Staten Island,
which is on the west side of the lower Bay. On the 12th came
in the <i>Eagle</i>, 64, carrying the flag of Lord Howe. This
officer was much esteemed by the Americans for his own
personal qualities, and for his attitude towards them in the
present dispute, as well as for the memory of his brother, who
had endeared himself greatly to them in the campaign of
1758, when he had fallen near Lake Champlain; but the decisive
step of declaring their independence had been taken
already, on July 4th, eight days before the Admiral's arrival.
A month was spent in fruitless attempts to negotiate with
the new government, without recognising any official character
in its representatives. During that time, however,
while abstaining from decisive operations, cruisers were kept
at sea to intercept American traders, and the Admiral,
immediately upon arriving, sent four vessels of war twenty-five
miles up the Hudson River, as far as Tarrytown. This
squadron was commanded by Hyde Parker, afterwards, in
1801, Nelson's commander-in-chief at Copenhagen. The
service was performed under a tremendous cannonade from
all the batteries on both shores, but the ships could not be
stopped. Towards the middle of August it was evident
that the Americans would not accept any terms in the power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>
of the Howes to offer, and it became necessary to attempt coercion by arms.</p>

New York and New Jersey: to illustrate Operations of 1776, 1777, and 1778</div>

<p>In the reduction of New York in 1776, the part played
by the British Navy, owing to the nature of the campaign in
general and of the enemy's force in particular, was of that inconspicuous
character which obscures the fact that without
the Navy the operations could not have been undertaken at
all, and that the Navy played to them the part of the base
of operations and line of communications. Like the foundations
of a building, these lie outside the range of superficial
attention, and therefore are less generally appreciated than
the brilliant fighting going on at the front, to the maintenance
of which they are all the time indispensable. Consequently,
whatever of interest may attach to any, or to all, of
the minor affairs, which in the aggregate constitute the action
of the naval force in such circumstances, the historian of
the major operations is confined perforce to indicating the
broad general effect of naval power upon the issue. This
will be best done by tracing in outline the scene of
action, the combined movements, and the Navy's influence in both.</p>

<p>The harbour of New York divides into two parts&mdash;the
upper and lower Bays&mdash;connected by a passage called the
Narrows, between Long and Staten Islands, upon the latter
of which the British troops were encamped. Long Island,
which forms the eastern shore of the Narrows, extends
to the east-north-east a hundred and ten miles, enclosing
between itself and the continent a broad sheet of water
called Long Island Sound, that reaches nearly to Narragansett
Bay. The latter, being a fine anchorage, entered also into
the British scheme of operations, as an essential feature in a
coastwise maritime campaign. Long Island Sound and the
upper Bay of New York are connected by a crooked and
difficult passage, known as the East River, eight or ten miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
in length, and at that time nearly a mile wide<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> abreast the
city of New York. At the point where the East River joins
New York Bay, the Hudson River, an estuary there nearly
two miles wide, also enters from the north,&mdash;a circumstance
which has procured for it the alternative name of the North
River. Near their confluence is Governor's Island, half a
mile below the town, centrally situated to command the
entrances to both. Between the East and North rivers,
with their general directions from north and east-north-east,
is embraced a long strip of land gradually narrowing to the
southward. The end of this peninsula, as it would otherwise
be, is converted into an island, of a mean length of about
eight miles, by the Harlem River,&mdash;a narrow and partially
navigable stream connecting the East and North rivers. To
the southern extreme of this island, called Manhattan, the
city of New York was then confined.</p>

<p>As both the East and North rivers were navigable for large
ships, the former throughout, the latter for over a hundred
miles above its mouth, it was evident that control of the water
must play a large part in warlike operations throughout
the district described. With the limited force at Washington's
disposal, he had been unable to push the defences of
the city as far to the front as was desirable. The lower Bay
was held by the British Navy, and Staten Island had been
abandoned, necessarily, without resistance, thereby giving up
the strong defensive position of the Narrows. The lines
were contracted thus to the immediate neighbourhood of New
York itself. Small detached works skirted the shores of Manhattan
Island, and a line of redoubts extended across it, following
the course of a small stream which then partly divided
it, a mile from the southern end. Governor's Island was also
occupied as an outpost. Of more intrinsic strength, but not
at first concerned, strong works had been thrown up on either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
side of the North River, upon commanding heights eight
miles above New York, to dispute the passage of ships.</p>

<p>The crucial weakness in this scheme of defence was that
the shore of Long Island opposite the city was much higher
than that of Manhattan. If this height were seized, the
city, and all below it, became untenable. Here, therefore,
was the key of the position and the chief station for the American
troops. For its protection a line of works was thrown up,
the flanks of which rested upon Wallabout Bay and Gowanus
Cove, two indentations in the shores of Long Island. These
Washington manned with nine thousand of the eighteen
thousand men under his command. By the arrival of three
divisions of Hessian troops, Howe's army now numbered
over thirty-four thousand men, to which Clinton brought
three thousand more from before Charleston.<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>On the 22d of August the British crossed from Staten
Island to Gravesend Bay, on the Long Island shore of the
Narrows. The Navy covered the landing, and the transportation
of the troops was under the charge of Commodore
William Hotham, who, nineteen years later, was Nelson's
commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. By noon fifteen
thousand men and forty field-guns had been carried over and
placed on shore. The force of the Americans permitted little
opposition to the British advance; but General Howe was
cautious and easy-going, and it was not till the 27th that the
army, now increased to twenty-five thousand, was fairly in
front of the American lines, having killed, wounded, and taken
about 1,500 men. Hoping that Howe would be tempted to
storm the position, Washington replaced these with two
thousand drawn from his meagre numbers; but his opponent,
who had borne a distinguished part at Bunker's Hill, held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>
back his troops, who were eager for the assault. The
Americans now stood with their backs to a swift tidal stream,
nearly a mile wide, with only a feeble line of works between
them and an enemy more than double their number.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th, Sir Peter Parker, with a 64-gun
ship, two 50's, and two frigates, attempted to work up to
New York, with a view of supporting the left flank of the
army; but the wind came out from the north, and, the
ebb-tide making, the ships got no nearer than three miles
from the city. Fortunately for the Americans, they either
could not or would not go farther on the following two days.
After dark of the 28th, Howe broke ground for regular
approaches. Washington, seeing this, and knowing that there
could be but one result to a siege under his condition of
inferiority, resolved to withdraw. During the night of the
29th ten thousand men silently quitted their positions, embarked,
and crossed to Manhattan Island, carrying with
them all their belongings, arms, and ammunition. The
enemy's trenches were but six hundred yards distant, yet no
suspicion was aroused, nor did a single deserter give treacherous
warning. The night was clear and moonlit, although
a heavy fog towards daybreak prolonged the period of secrecy
which shrouded the retreat. When the fog rose, the
last detachment was discovered crossing, but a few ineffectual
cannon-shot were the only harassment experienced by the
Americans in the course of this rapid and dexterous retirement.
The garrison of Governor's Island was withdrawn at the same time.</p>

<p>The unmolested use of the water, and the nautical skill
of the fishermen who composed one of the American regiments,
were essential to this escape; for admirable as the
movement was in arrangement and execution, no word
less strong than escape applies to it. By it Washington
rescued over half his army from sure destruction, and, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>
improbably, the cause of his people from immediate collapse.
An opportunity thus seized implies necessarily an opportunity
lost on the other side. For that failure both army and navy
must bear their share of the blame. It is obvious that when an
enemy is greatly outnumbered his line of retreat should be
watched. This was the business of both commanders-in-chief,
the execution of it being primarily the duty of the navy, as
withdrawal from the American position could be only by water.
It was a simple question of look-out, of detection, of prevention
by that means. To arrest the retreat sailing ships
were inadequate, for they could not have remained at
anchor under the guns of Manhattan Island, either by day or
night; but a few boats with muffled oars could have watched,
could have given the alarm, precipitating an attack by the
army, and such a movement interrupted in mid-course brings
irretrievable disaster.</p>

<p>Washington now withdrew the bulk of his force to the line
of the Harlem. On his right, south of that river and commanding
the Hudson, was a fort called by his name; opposite
to it on the Jersey shore was Fort Lee. A garrison of
four thousand men occupied New York. After amusing himself
with some further peace negotiations, Howe determined
to possess the city. As a diversion from the main effort,
and to cover the crossing of the troops, two detachments of
ships were ordered to pass the batteries on the Hudson and
East rivers. This was done on the 13th and the 15th of
September. The East River division suffered severely,
especially in spars and rigging;<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a> but the success of both,
following upon that of Hyde Parker a few weeks earlier, in
his expedition to Tarrytown, confirmed Washington in the
opinion which he expressed five years later to de Grasse,
that batteries alone could not stop ships having a fair wind.
This is now a commonplace of naval warfare; steam giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span>
always a fair wind. On the 15th Howe's army crossed under
cover of Parker's ships, Hotham again superintending the
boat work. The garrison of New York slipped along the
west shore of the island and joined the main body on the Harlem;
favored again, apparently, in this flank movement a
mile from the enemy's front, by Howe's inertness, and fondness
for a good meal, to which a shrewd American woman
invited him at the critical moment.</p>

<p>Despite these various losses of position, important as they
were, the American army continued to elude the British
general, who apparently did not hold very strongly the
opinion that the most decisive factor in war is the enemy's
organised force. As control of the valley of the Hudson,
in connection with Lake Champlain, was, very properly,
the chief object of the British government, Howe's next aim
was to loosen Washington's grip on the peninsula north of
the Harlem. The position seeming to him too strong for a
front attack, he decided to strike for its left flank and rear
by way of Long Island Sound. In this, which involved the
passage of the tortuous and dangerous channel called Hell
Gate, with its swift conflicting currents, the Navy again
bore an essential part. The movement began on October
12th, the day after Arnold was defeated at Valcour. So far
as its leading object went it was successful, Washington
feeling obliged to let go the line of the Harlem, and change
front to the left. As the result of the various movements
and encounters of the two armies, he fell back across the Hudson
into New Jersey, ordering the evacuation of Fort Washington,
and deciding to rest his control of the Hudson Valley
upon West Point, fifty miles above New York, a position of
peculiar natural strength, on the west bank of the river. To
these decisions he was compelled by his inferiority in numbers,
and also by the very isolated and hazardous situation in
which he was operating, between two navigable waters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>
absolutely controlled by the enemy's shipping. This conclusion
was further forced upon him by another successful
passage before the guns of Forts Washington and Lee by
Hyde Parker, with three ships, on the 9th of October. On
this occasion the vessels, two of which were frigates of the
heaviest class, suffered very severely, losing nine killed and
eighteen wounded; but the menace to the communications
of the Americans could not be disregarded, for their supplies
came mostly from the west of the Hudson.</p>

<p>It was early in November that Washington crossed into
New Jersey with five thousand men; and soon afterwards
he directed the remainder of his force to follow. At that
moment the blunder of one subordinate, and the disobedience
of another, brought upon him two serious blows. Fort
Washington not being evacuated when ordered, Howe
carried it by storm, capturing not only it but its garrison
of twenty-seven hundred men; a very heavy loss to the
Americans. On the other hand, the most explicit orders
failed to bring the officer left in command on the east of the
Hudson, General Charles Lee, to rejoin the commander-in-chief.
This criminal perverseness left Washington with
only six thousand men in New Jersey, seven thousand being
in New York. Under these conditions nothing remained but
to put the Delaware also between himself and the enemy. He
therefore retreated rapidly through New Jersey, and on the
8th of December crossed into Pennsylvania with an army reduced
to three thousand by expiry of enlistments. The
detachment beyond the Hudson, diminishing daily by the
same cause, gradually worked its way to him; its commander
luckily being captured on the road. At the time it joined, a
few battalions also arrived from Ticonderoga, released by
Carleton's retirement to the foot of Champlain. Washington's
force on the west bank of the Delaware was thus increased to six thousand men.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>

<p>In this series of operations, extending from August 22d
to December 14th, when Howe went into winter-quarters in
New Jersey, the British had met with no serious mishaps,
beyond the inevitable losses undergone by the assailants
of well-chosen positions. Nevertheless, having in view the
superiority of numbers, of equipment, and of discipline, and
the command of the water, the mere existence of the enemy's
army as an organised body, its mere escape, deprives the campaign
of the claim to be considered successful. The red
ribbon of the Bath probably never was earned more cheaply
than by Sir William Howe that year. Had he displayed anything
like the energy of his two elder brothers, Washington,
with all his vigilance, firmness, and enterprise, could scarcely
have brought off the force, vastly diminished but still a living
organism, around which American resistance again crystallised
and hardened. As it was, within a month he took the
offensive, and recovered a great part of New Jersey.</p>

<p>Whatever verdict may be passed upon the merit of the
military conduct of affairs, there is no doubt of the value, or
of the unflagging energy, of the naval support given. Sir
William Howe alludes to it frequently, both in general and
specifically; while the Admiral sums up his always guarded
and often cumbrous expressions of opinion in these words:
"It is incumbent upon me to represent to your Lordships,
and I cannot too pointedly express, the unabating perseverance
and alacrity with which the several classes of
officers and seamen have supported a long attendance and
unusual degree of fatigue, consequent of these different movements of the army."</p>

<p>The final achievement of the campaign, and a very important
one, was the occupation of Rhode Island and Narragansett
Bay by a combined expedition, which left New York
on the 1st of December, and on the 8th landed at Newport
without opposition. The naval force, consisting of five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>
50-gun ships and eight smaller vessels, was commanded by
Sir Peter Parker; the troops, seven thousand in number,
by Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton. The immediate
effect was to close a haven of privateers, who centred in great
numbers around an anchorage which flanked the route of
all vessels bound from Europe to New York. The possession
of the bay facilitated the control of the neighbouring
waters by British ships of war, besides giving them a base
central for coastwise operations and independent of tidal
considerations for entrance or exit. The position was
abandoned somewhat precipitately three years later. Rodney
then deplored its loss in the following terms: "The evacuating
Rhode Island was the most fatal measure that could
possibly have been adopted. It gave up the best and noblest
harbor in America, capable of containing the whole Navy
of Britain, and where they could in all seasons lie in perfect
security; and from whence squadrons, in forty-eight hours,
could blockade the three capital cities of America; namely,
Boston, New York, and Philadelphia."</p>

<p>At the end of 1776 began the series of British reverses
which characterised the year 1777, making this the decisive
period of the war, because of the effect thus produced upon
general public opinion abroad; especially upon the governments
of France and Spain. On the 20th of December,
Howe, announcing to the Ministry that he had gone into
winter-quarters, wrote: "The chain, I own, is rather too
extensive, but I was induced to occupy Burlington to cover
the county of Monmouth; and trusting to the loyalty of
the inhabitants, and the strength of the corps placed in the
advanced posts, I conclude the troops will be in perfect security."
Of this unwarranted security Washington took
prompt advantage. On Christmas night a sudden descent,
in a blinding snow-storm, upon a British outpost at Trenton,
swept off a thousand prisoners; and although for the moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>
the American leader again retired behind the Delaware, it
was but to resume the offensive four days later. Cornwallis,
who was in New York on the point of sailing for England,
hurried back to the front, but in vain. A series of quick and
well-directed movements recovered the State of New Jersey;
and by the 5th of January the American headquarters, and
main body of the army, were established at Morristown
in the Jersey hills, the left resting upon the Hudson, thus
recovering touch with the strategic centre of interest. This
menacing position of the Americans, upon the flank of the
line of communications from New York to the Delaware,
compelled Howe to contract abruptly the lines he had extended
so lightly; and the campaign he was forced thus reluctantly
to reopen closed under a gloom of retreat and disaster,
which profoundly and justly impressed not only the
generality of men but military critics as well. "Of all the
great conquests which his Majesty's troops had made in
the Jersies," writes Beatson, "Brunswick and Amboy were the
only two places of any note which they retained; and however
brilliant their successes had been in the beginning of the
campaign, they reaped little advantage from them when the
winter advanced, and the contiguity of so vigilant an
enemy forced them to perform the severest duty." With
deliberate or unconscious humour he then immediately concludes
the chronicle of the year with this announcement:
"His Majesty was so well pleased with the abilities and activity
which General Howe had displayed this campaign, that
on the 25th of October he conferred upon him the Most
Honourable Order of the Bath."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE DECISIVE PERIOD OF THE WAR. SURRENDER OF BURGOYNE AND CAPTURE OF
PHILADELPHIA BY HOWE. THE NAVAL PART IN EACH OPERATION<br />

1777</h3>


<p>The leading purpose of the British government in
the campaign of 1777 was the same as that with
which it had begun in 1776,&mdash;the control
of the line of the Hudson and Lake Champlain,
to be mastered by two expeditions, one starting from each
end, and both working towards a common centre at Albany,
near the head of navigation of the River. Preliminary difficulties
had been cleared away in the previous year, by the
destruction of the American flotilla on the Lake, and by the
reduction of New York. To both these objects the Navy
had contributed conspicuously. It remained to complete
the work by resuming the advance from the two bases of
operations secured. In 1777 the fortifications on the Hudson
were inadequate to stop the progress of a combined naval
and military expedition, as was shown in the course of the campaign.</p>

<p>The northern enterprise was intrusted to General Burgoyne.
The impossibility of creating a new naval force, able to contend
with that put afloat by Carleton, had prevented
the Americans from further building. Burgoyne therefore
moved by the Lake without opposition to Ticonderoga,
before which he appeared on the 2d of July. A position
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
commanding the works was discovered, which the Americans
had neglected to occupy. It being seized, and a battery
established, the fort had to be evacuated. The retreat
being made by water, the British Lake Navy, under Captain
Skeffington Lutwidge, with whom Nelson had served a few
years before in the Arctic seas, had a conspicuous part in the
pursuit; severing the boom blockading the narrow upper
lake and joining impetuously in an attack upon the floating
material, the flat-boat transports, and the few relics of
Arnold's flotilla which had escaped the destruction of the
previous year. This affair took place on the 6th of July.
From that time forward the progress of the army was mainly
by land. The Navy, however, found occupation upon
Lake George, where Burgoyne established a d&#233;p&#244;t of supplies,
although he did not utilise its waterway for the march
of the army. A party of seamen under Edward Pellew, still a
midshipman, accompanied the advance, and shared the misfortunes
of the expedition. It is told that Burgoyne used
afterwards to chaff the young naval officer with being the
cause of their disaster, because he and his men, by rebuilding
a bridge at a critical moment, had made it possible to cross
the upper Hudson. Impeded in its progress by immense
difficulties, both natural and imposed by the enemy, the army
took twenty days to make twenty miles. On the 30th of
July it reached Fort Edward, forty miles from Albany, and
there was compelled to stay till the middle of September.
Owing to neglect at the War Office, the peremptory orders to
Sir William Howe, to move up the Hudson and make a junction
with Burgoyne, were not sent forward. Consequently,
Howe, acting upon the discretionary powers which he possessed
already, and swayed by political reasons into which it
is not necessary to enter, determined to renew his attempt
upon Philadelphia. A tentative advance into New Jersey,
and the consequent man&oelig;uvres of Washington, satisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>
him that the enterprise by this route was too hazardous.
He therefore embarked fourteen thousand men, leaving
eight thousand with Sir Henry Clinton to hold New York and
make diversions in favor of Burgoyne; and on the 23d of
July sailed from Sandy Hook, escorted by five 64-gun ships,
a 50, and ten smaller vessels, under Lord Howe's immediate
command. The entire expedition numbered about 280 sail.
Elaborate pains were taken to deceive Washington as to the
destination of the armament; but little craft was needed to
prevent a competent opponent from imagining a design so
contrary to sound military principle, having regard to Burgoyne's
movements and to the well-understood general
purpose of the British ministry. Accordingly Washington
wrote, "Howe's in a manner abandoning Burgoyne is so
unaccountable a matter, that till I am fully assured of it, I
cannot help casting my eyes continually behind me." He
suspected an intention to return upon New York.</p>

<p>On the 31st of July, just as Burgoyne reached Fort Edward,
where he stuck fast for six weeks, Howe's armament
was off the Capes of the Delaware. The prevailing summer
wind on the American coast is south-south-west, fair for
ascending the river; but information was received that the
enemy had obstructed the channel, which lends itself to such
defences for some distance below Philadelphia. Therefore,
although after occupying the city the free navigation of the
river to the sea would be essential to maintaining the position,&mdash;for
trial had shown that the whole army could not assure
communications by land with New York, the other sea base,&mdash;Howe
decided to prosecute his enterprise by way of the
Chesapeake, the ascent of which, under all the conditions,
could not be seriously impeded. A fortnight more was consumed
in contending against the south-west winds and calms,
before the fleet anchored on the 15th of August within the
Capes of the Chesapeake; and yet another week passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>
before the head of the Bay was reached. On the 25th the
troops landed. Washington, though so long in doubt, was
on hand to dispute the road, but in inferior force; and Howe
had no great difficulty in fighting his way to Philadelphia,
which was occupied on the 26th of September. A week
earlier Burgoyne had reached Stillwater, on the west bank of
the Hudson, the utmost point of his progress, where he was
still twenty miles from Albany. Three weeks later, confronted
by overwhelming numbers, he was forced to capitulate
at Saratoga, whither he had retreated.</p>

<p>Lord Howe held on at the head of the Chesapeake until
satisfied that his brother no longer needed him. On the 14th
of September he started down the Bay with the squadron
and convoy, sending ahead to the Delaware a small division,
to aid the army, if necessary. The winds holding southerly,
ten days were required to get to sea; and outside further
delay was caused by very heavy weather. The Admiral
there quitted the convoy and hastened up river. On the
6th of October he was off Chester, ten miles below Philadelphia.
The navy had already been at work for a week,
clearing away obstructions, of which there were two lines;
both commanded by batteries on the farther, or Jersey, shore
of the Delaware. The lower battery had been carried by
troops; and when Howe arrived, the ships, though meeting
lively opposition from the American galleys and fire-rafts,
had freed the channel for large vessels to approach the upper
obstructions. These were defended not only by a work at
Red Bank on the Jersey shore, but also, on the other side
of the stream, by a fort called Fort Mifflin, on Mud Island.<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>
As the channel at this point, for a distance of half a mile, was
only two hundred yards wide, and troops could not reach the
island, the position was very strong, and it detained the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
for six weeks. Fort Mifflin was supported by two floating
batteries and a number of galleys. The latter not only
fought, offensively and defensively, but maintained the
supplies and ammunition of the garrison.</p>

<p>On the 22d of October, a concerted attack, by the army
on the works at Red Bank, and by the Navy on Fort Mifflin,
resulted disastrously. The former was repulsed with considerable
loss, the officer commanding being killed. The
squadron, consisting of a 64, three frigates, and a sloop,
went into action with Mud Island at the same time; but, the
channel having shifted, owing possibly to the obstructions,
the sixty-four and the sloop grounded, and could not be
floated that day. On the 23d the Americans concentrated
their batteries, galleys, and fire-rafts upon the two; and the
larger ship took fire and blew up in the midst of the preparations
for lightening her. The sloop was then set on fire and abandoned.</p>

<p>So long as this obstacle remained, all supplies for the
British army in Philadelphia had to be carried by boats to
the shore, and transported considerable distances by land.
As direct attacks had proved unavailing, more deliberate
measures were adopted. The army built batteries, and
the navy sent ashore guns to mount in them; but the
decisive blow to Mud Island was given by a small armed
ship, the <i>Vigilant</i>, 20, which was successfully piloted through
a channel on the west side of the river, and reached the rear
of the work, towing with her a floating battery with three
24-pounders. This was on the 15th of November. That
night the Americans abandoned Fort Mifflin. Their loss,
Beatson says, amounted to near 400 killed and wounded;
that of the British to 43. If this be correct, it should have
established the invincibility of men who under such prodigious
disparity of suffering could maintain their position
so tenaciously. After the loss of Mud Island, Red Bank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>
could not be held to advantage, and it was evacuated on the
21st, when an attack was imminent. The American vessels
retreated up the river; but they were cornered, and of course
ultimately were destroyed. The obstructions being now
removed, the British water communications by the line of
the Delaware were established,&mdash;eight weeks after the
occupation of the city, which was to be evacuated necessarily six months later.</p>

<p>While these things were passing, Howe's triumph was
marred by the news of Burgoyne's surrender on the 17th of
October. For this he could not but feel that the home
government must consider him largely responsible; for
in the Chesapeake, too late to retrieve his false step, he had
received a letter from the minister of war saying that,
whatever else he undertook, support to Burgoyne was the
great object to be kept in view.</p>

<p>During the operations round Philadelphia, Sir Henry
Clinton in New York had done enough to show what strong
probabilities of success would have attended an advance up
the Hudson, by the twenty thousand men whom Howe could
have taken with him. Starting on the 3d of October with
three thousand troops, accompanied by a small naval division
of frigates, Clinton in a week had reached West Point, fifty
miles up the river. The American fortifications along the
way were captured, defences levelled, stores and shipping
burned; while an insignificant detachment, with the light
vessels, went fifty miles further up, and there destroyed more
military stores without encountering any resistance worth
mentioning. Certainly, had Howe taken the same line of
operations, he would have had to reckon with Washington's
ten thousand men which confronted him on the march from
the Chesapeake to Philadelphia; but his flank would have
been covered, up to Albany, by a navigable stream on either
side of which he could operate by that flying bridge which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
presence and control of the navy continually constituted.
Save the fortifications, which Clinton easily carried, there
was no threat to his communications or to his flank, such as
the hill country of New Jersey had offered and Washington
had skilfully utilised.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1777 thus ended for the British with a
conspicuous disaster, and with an apparent success which
was as disastrous as a failure. At its close they held Narragansett
Bay, the city and harbour of New York, and the
city of Philadelphia. The first was an admirable naval
base, especially for sailing ships, for the reasons given by
Rodney. The second was then, as it is now, the greatest
military position on the Atlantic coast of the United States;
and although the two could not communicate by land, they
did support each other as naval stations in a war essentially
dependent upon maritime power. Philadelphia served no
purpose but to divide and distract British enterprise. Absolutely
dependent for maintenance upon the sea, the forces
in it and in New York could not co&#246;perate; they could not
even unite except by sea. When Clinton relieved Howe
as commander-in-chief, though less than a hundred miles
away by land, he had to take a voyage of over two hundred
miles, from New York to Philadelphia, half of it up a difficult
river, to reach his station; and troops were transferred by
the same tedious process. In consequence of these conditions,
the place had to be abandoned the instant that war
with France made control of the sea even doubtful. The
British held it for less than nine months in all.</p>

<p>During 1777 a number of raids were made by British
combined land and sea forces, for the purpose of destroying
American d&#233;p&#244;ts and other resources. Taken together, such
operations are subsidiary to, and aid, the great object of interrupting
or harassing the communications of an enemy. In
so far, they have a standing place among the major operations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>
of war; but taken singly they cannot be so reckoned,
and the fact, therefore, is simply noted, without going into
details. It may be remarked, however, that in them, although
the scale was smaller, the Navy played the same
part that it now does in the many expeditions and small
wars undertaken by Great Britain in various parts of the
world; the same that it did in Wellington's campaigns in
the Spanish peninsula, 1808-1812. The land force depended
upon the water, and the water was controlled by the Navy.</p>

<h3>WAR BEGINS BETWEEN FRANCE AND GREAT

OF LORD HOWE. AMERICAN DISAPPOINTMENT IN D'ESTAING. LORD HOWE

1778</h3>


<p>The events of 1777 satisfied the French government
that the Americans had strength and skill
sufficient to embarrass Great Britain seriously,
and that the moment, therefore, was opportune
for taking steps which scarcely could fail to cause war. On
the 6th of February, 1778, France concluded with the United
States an open treaty of amity and commerce; and at the
same time a second secret treaty, acknowledging the independence
of the late Colonies, and contracting with them a
defensive alliance. On the 13th of March, the French Ambassador
in London communicated the open treaty to the
British government, with the remark that "the United States
were in full possession of the independence proclaimed by
their declaration of July 4th, 1776." Great Britain at once
recalled her Ambassador, and both countries prepared for
war, although no declaration was issued. On the 13th of
April, a French fleet of twelve ships of the line and five frigates,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>
under the command of the Count d'Estaing,<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a> sailed
from Toulon for the American coast. It was destined to
Delaware Bay, hoping to intercept Howe's squadron. D'Estaing
was directed to begin hostilities when forty leagues west of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The British ministry was not insensible of the danger,
the imminence of which had been felt during the previous
year; but it had not got ready betimes, owing possibly to
confident expectations of success from the campaign of
1777. The ships, in point of numbers and equipment, were
not as far forward as the Admiralty had represented; and
difficulty, amounting for the moment to impossibility, was
experienced in manning them. The vessels of the Channel
fleet had to be robbed of both crews and stores to compose
a proper reinforcement for America. Moreover, the destination
of the Toulon squadron was unknown, the French government
having given out that it was bound to Brest, where over
twenty other ships of the line were in an advanced state of
preparation. Not until the 5th of June, when d'Estaing
was already eight weeks out, was certain news brought by a
frigate, which had watched his fleet after it had passed
Gibraltar, and which had accompanied it into the Atlantic
ninety leagues west of the Straits. The reinforcement
for America was then permitted to depart. On the 9th of
June, thirteen ships of the line sailed for New York under
the command of Vice-Admiral John Byron.<a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>These delays occasioned a singular and striking illustration
of the ill effects upon commerce of inadequate preparation
for manning the fleet. A considerable number of West
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
India ships, with stores absolutely necessary for the preservation
of the islands, waited at Portsmouth for convoy for upwards
of three months, while the whole fleet, of eighty sail,
was detained for five weeks after it had assembled; "and,
although the wind came fair on the 19th of May, it did not
sail till the 26th, owing to the convoying ships, the <i>Boyne</i>
and the <i>Ruby</i>, not being ready." Forty-five owners and
masters signed a letter to the Admiralty, stating these
facts. "The convoy," they said, "was appointed to sail
April 10th." Many ships had been ready as early as February.
"Is not this shameful usage, my Lords, thus to deceive
the public in general? There are two hundred ships loaded
with provisions, etc., waiting at Spithead these three months.
The average expense of each ship amounts to £150 monthly,
so that the expense of the whole West India fleet since February
amounts to £90,000."</p>

<p>The West Indies before the war had depended chiefly
upon their fellow colonies on the American continent for
provisions, as well as for other prime necessaries. Not only
were these cut off as an incident of the war, entailing great
embarrassment and suffering, which elicited vehement appeals
from the planter community to the home government,
but the American privateers preyed heavily upon the commerce
of the islands, whose industries were thus smitten
root and branch, import and export. In 1776, salt food for
whites and negroes had risen from 50 to 100 per cent, and
corn, the chief support of the slaves,&mdash;the laboring class,&mdash;by
400 per cent. At the same time sugar had fallen from
25 to 40 per cent in price, rum over 37 per cent. The words
"starvation" and "famine" were freely used in these representations,
which were repeated in 1778. Insurance rose to
23 per cent; and this, with actual losses by capture,<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a> and by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>
cessation of American trade, with consequent fall of prices,
was estimated to give a total loss of £66 upon every £100
earned before the war. Yet, with all this, the outward West
India fleet in 1778 waited six weeks, April 10th-May 26th,
for convoy. Immediately after it got away, a rigorous embargo
was laid upon all shipping in British ports, that their
crews might be impressed to man the Channel fleet. Market-boats,
even, were not allowed to pass between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>Three days after Byron had sailed, Admiral Augustus
Keppel also put to sea with twenty-one ships of the line, to
cruise off Brest. His instructions were to prevent the
junction of the Toulon and Brest divisions, attacking either
that he might meet. On the 17th of June, two French frigates
were sighted. In order that they might not report
his force or his movements, the British Admiral sent two
of his own frigates, with the request that they would speak
him. One, the <i>Belle Poule</i>, 36, refused; and an engagement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>
followed between her and the British ship, the <i>Arethusa</i>,
32. The King of France subsequently declared that this
occurrence fixed the date of the war's beginning. Although
both Keppel's and d'Estaing's orders prescribed acts of
hostility, no formal war yet existed.</p>

<p>Byron had a very tempestuous passage, with adverse winds,
by which his vessels were scattered and damaged. On the
18th of August, sixty-seven days from Plymouth, the flagship
arrived off the south coast of Long Island, ninety miles
east of New York, without one of the fleet in company.
There twelve ships were seen at anchor to leeward (north),
nine or ten miles distant, having jury masts, and showing
other signs of disability. The British vessel approached
near enough to recognise them as French. They were
d'Estaing's squadron, crippled by a very heavy gale, in
which Howe's force had also suffered, though to a less extent.
Being alone, and ignorant of existing conditions,
Byron thought it inexpedient to continue on for either
New York or Narragansett Bay. The wind being southerly,
he steered for Halifax, which he reached August 26th. Some
of his ships also entered there. A very few had already
succeeded in joining Howe in New York, being fortunate
enough to escape the enemy.</p>

<p>So far as help from England went, Lord Howe would have
been crushed long before this. He owed his safety partly
to his own celerity, partly to the delays of his opponent.
Early in May he received advices from home, which convinced
him that a sudden and rapid abandonment of Philadelphia
and of Delaware Bay might become necessary. He
therefore withdrew his ships of the line from New York
and Narragansett, concentrating them at the mouth of
Delaware Bay, while the transports embarked all stores,
except those needed for a fortnight's supply of the army in a
hostile country. The threatening contingency of a superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>
enemy's appearing off the coast might, and did, make it
imperative not to risk the troops at sea, but to choose instead
the alternative of a ninety-mile march through New Jersey,
which a year before had been rejected as too hazardous for
an even larger force. Thus prepared, no time was lost
when the evacuation became necessary. Sir William Howe,
who had been relieved on the 24th of May by Sir Henry
Clinton, and had returned to England, escaped the humiliation
of giving up his dearly bought conquest. On the 18th
of June the British troops, twelve thousand in number, were
ferried across the Delaware, under the supervision of the
Navy, and began their hazardous march to New York. The
next day the transports began to move down the river; but,
owing to the intricate navigation, head winds, and calms,
they did not get to sea until the 28th of June. On the 8th of
July, ten days too late, d'Estaing anchored in the mouth of
the Delaware. "Had a passage of even ordinary length
taken place," wrote Washington, "Lord Howe with the British
ships of war and all the transports in the river Delaware
must inevitably have fallen; and Sir Henry Clinton must
have had better luck than is commonly dispensed to men of
his profession under such circumstances, if he and his troops
had not shared at least the fate of Burgoyne."</p>

<p>Had Howe's fleet been intercepted, there would have been
no naval defence for New York; the French fleet would have
surmounted the difficulties of the harbour bar at its ease;
and Clinton, caught between it and the American army,
must have surrendered. Howe's arrival obviated this
immediate danger; but much still needed to be done, or the
end would be postponed only, not averted. A fair wind
carried the fleet and the whole convoy from the Delaware
to Sandy Hook in forty-eight hours. On the morning of
the 29th, as Howe was approaching his port, he spoke a
packet from England, which not only brought definite news
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>
of d'Estaing's sailing, but also reported that she herself had
fallen in with him to the southward, not very far from the
American coast, and had been chased by his ships. His
appearance off New York, therefore, was imminent.</p>

<p>Howe's measures were prompt and thorough, as became
his great reputation. To watch for d'Estaing's approach, a
body of cruisers was despatched, numerous enough for some
to bring frequent word of his movements, while others
kept touch with him. The ships at New York were ordered
down to Sandy Hook, where the defence of the entrance was
to be made. Clinton, who had been hard pressed by Washington
throughout his march, arrived on the 30th of June&mdash;the
day after Howe himself&mdash;on the heights of Navesink, on
the seacoast, just south of Sandy Hook. During the previous
winter the sea had made a breach between the heights
and the Hook, converting the latter into an island. Across
this inlet the Navy threw a bridge of boats, by which the
army on the 5th of July passed to the Hook, and thence was conveyed to the city.</p>

<p>On the same day the French fleet was sighted off the coast of
Virginia by a cruiser, which reached Howe on the 7th; and
two days later another brought word that the enemy had
anchored on the 8th off the Delaware. There d'Estaing
again tarried for two days, which were diligently improved
by the British Admiral, who at the same time sent off despatches
to warn Byron, of whose coming he now had heard.
Despite all his energy, his preparations still were far from
complete, when on the morning of the 11th a third vessel
arrived, announcing that the French were approaching.
That evening they anchored outside, four miles south of
Sandy Hook. Howe, who during all these days was indefatigable,
not only in planning but also in personal supervision
of details, hastened at once to place his vessels according
to the disposition which he had determined, and which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>
had carefully explained to his captains, thus insuring an intelligent
co&#246;peration on their part.</p>

<p>The narrow arm of land called Sandy Hook projects in a
northerly direction from the New Jersey coast, and covers
the lower bay of New York on the south side. The main
ship-channel, then as now, ran nearly east and west, at right
angles to the Hook and close to its northern end. Beyond
the channel, to the north, there was no solid ground for
fortification within the cannon range of that day. Therefore
such guns as could be mounted on shore, five in number,
were placed in battery at the end of the Hook. These formed
the right flank of the defence, which was continued thence
to the westward by a line of seven ships, skirting the southern
edge of the channel. As the approach of the French, if they
attacked, must be with an easterly wind and a rising tide,
the ships were placed with that expectation; and in such
wise that, riding with their heads to the eastward, each successive
one, from van to rear, lay a little outside&mdash;north&mdash;of
her next ahead. The object of this indented formation
was that each ship might bring her broadside to bear east,
and yet fire clear of those to the east of her. In order to
effect this concentration of all the batteries in an easterly
direction, which would rake the approach of the enemy,
a spring<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a><a href="#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a> was run from the outer, or port quarter of every
ship, except the leader.<a id="footnotetag24" name="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a> These springs were not taken to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>
the bow cable or anchor, as was often done, but to anchors of
their own, placed broad off the port bows. If, then, the
enemy attacked, the ships, by simply keeping fast the springs
and veering the cables, would swing with their broadsides
facing east. If the enemy, which had no bow fire, survived
his punishment, and succeeded in advancing till abreast the
British line, it was necessary only to keep fast the cables and
let go the springs; the ships would swing head to the east wind,
and the broadsides would once more bear north, across the
channel instead of along it. These careful arrangements were
subject, of course, to the mischance of shot cutting away
cables or springs; but this was more than offset by the probable
injury to the enemy's spars and rigging, as well as hulls,
before he could use his batteries at all.</p>

<p>Such was the main defence arranged by Howe; with which
New York stood or fell. In the line were five 64's, one
50, and an armed storeship. An advanced line, of one
fifty with two smaller vessels, was placed just inside the bar&mdash;two
or three miles outside the Hook&mdash;to rake the enemy
as he crossed, retiring as he approached; and four galleys,
forming a second line, were also stationed for the same
purpose, across the channel, abreast of the Hook.<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a> The retreat
of these was secure into the shoal water, where they
could not be followed. One 64 and some frigates were
held as a reserve, inside the main line, to act as occasion
might require. The total available force was, six 64's,
three 50's, and six frigates. D'Estaing's fleet, in detail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>
consisted of one 90-gun ship, one 80, six 74's and one
50. Great as was this discrepancy between the opponents,
it was counterbalanced largely by Howe's skilful dispositions,
which his enemy could not circumvent. If
the latter once got alongside, there was little hope for
the British; but it was impossible for the French to evade
the primary necessity of undergoing a raking fire, without
reply, from the extreme range of their enemies' cannon up
to the moment of closing. The stake, however, was great,
and the apparent odds stirred to the bottom the fighting
blood of the British seamen. The ships of war being short-handed,
Howe called for volunteers from the transports.
Such numbers came forward that the agents of the vessels
scarcely could keep a watch on board; and many whose
names were not on the lists concealed themselves in the
boats which carried their companions to the fighting ships.
The masters and mates of merchantmen in the harbour
in like manner offered their services, taking their stations
at the guns. Others cruised off the coast in small boats, to
warn off approaching vessels; many of which nevertheless
fell into the enemy's hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile d'Estaing was in communication with Washington,
one of whose aides-de-camp visited his flagship. A
number of New York pilots also were sent. When these
learned the draught of the heavier French ships, they declared
that it was impossible to take them in; that there was
on the bar only twenty-three feet at high water. Had that
been really the case, Howe would not have needed to make
the preparations for defence that were visible to thousands
of eyes on sea and on shore; but d'Estaing, though personally
brave as a lion, was timid in his profession, which he had
entered at the age of thirty, without serving in the lower
grades. The assurances of the pilots were accepted after
an examination by a lieutenant of the flagship, who could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>
find nothing deeper than twenty-two feet. Fortune's favors
are thrown away, as though in mockery, on the incompetent
or the irresolute. On the 22d of July a fresh north-east
wind concurred with a spring tide to give the highest possible
water on the bar.<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a><a href="#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<blockquote><p>
"At eight o'clock," wrote an eye-witness in the British fleet,
"d'Estaing with all his squadron appeared under way. He kept
working to windward, as if to gain a proper position for crossing the
bar by the time the tide should serve. The wind could not be more
favourable for such a design; it blew from the exact point from
which he could attack us to the greatest advantage. The spring
tides were at the highest, and that afternoon thirty feet on the bar.
We consequently expected the hottest day that had ever been fought
between the two nations. On our side all was at stake. Had the
men-of-war been defeated, the fleet of transports and victuallers
must have been destroyed, and the army, of course, have fallen with
us. D'Estaing, however, had not spirit equal to the risk; at three
o'clock we saw him bear off to the southward, and in a few hours
he was out of sight."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Four days later, Howe, reporting these occurrences, wrote:
"The weather having been favourable the last three days
for forcing entrance to this port, I conclude the French
commander has desisted." It is clear that the experienced
British admiral did not recognise the impossibility of success for the enemy.</p>

<p>After the demonstration of the 22d, d'Estaing stood to the
southward, with the wind at east. The British advice-boats
brought back word that they had kept company with
him as far south as the Capes of the Delaware, and there
had left him ninety miles from land. When their leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>
freed him from observation, he turned, and made for Narragansett
Bay, an attack on which, in support of an American
land force, had been concerted between him and Washington.
On the 29th he anchored three miles south of Rhode
Island, and there awaited a suitable moment for forcing the entrance.</p>

<p>Narragansett Bay contains several islands. The two
largest, near the sea, are Rhode Island and Conanicut,
the latter being the more westerly. Their general direction,
as that of the Bay itself, is north and south; and by them
the entrance is divided into three passages. Of these, the
eastern, called Seakonnet, is not navigable above Rhode
Island. The central, which is the main channel, is joined
by the western above Conanicut, and thus the two lead to the
upper Bay. The town of Newport is on the west side of
Rhode Island, four miles from the main entrance.</p>

<p>On the 30th of July, the day after the French fleet had
arrived, two of its ships of the line, under command of the
afterwards celebrated Suffren, went up the western channel,
anchoring within it near the south end of Conanicut. One
of them, as she passed, was hulled twice by the British batteries.
At the same time, two frigates and a corvette entered
Seakonnet; whereupon the British abandoned and burned a
sloop of war, the <i>Kingfisher</i>, 16, and some galleys there
stationed. The British general, Sir Robert Pigot, now
withdrew his detachments from Conanicut, after disabling the
guns, and concentrated the bulk of his force in the southern
part of Rhode Island and about Newport. Goat Island,
which covers the inner harbour of the town, was still occupied,
the main channel being commanded by its batteries, as well
as by those to the north and south of it upon Rhode Island.
On the 5th of August, Suffren's two ships again got under
way, sailed through the western passage, and anchored in the
main channel, north of Conanicut; their former positions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>
being taken by two other ships of the line.<a id="footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a> The senior
British naval officer, seeing retreat cut off both north and
south, now destroyed those ships of war<a id="footnotetag28" name="footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a> which could not
enter the inner harbour, sinking two between Goat and Rhode
Islands, to prevent any enemy passing there. Five transports
also were sunk north of Goat Island, between it and Coaster's
Harbour, to protect the inside anchorage in that direction.
These preliminary operations cost the British five frigates
and two sloops, besides some galleys. Guns and ammunition
taken from them went to increase the defences; and their
officers and crews, over a thousand in number, served in the fortifications.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/70.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/70.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Narragansett Bay</div>

<p>On the 8th of August the eight remaining French ships of
the line ran the batteries on Rhode and Goat Islands, anchoring
above the latter, between it and Conanicut, and
were rejoined there by the four previously detached to the
western passage. Ten thousand American troops having by
this time crossed from the mainland to the northern part of
Rhode Island, d'Estaing immediately landed four thousand
soldiers and seamen from the fleet upon Conanicut, for a
preliminary organisation; after which they also were to
pass to Rhode Island and join in the operations. For the
moment, therefore, the British garrison, numbering probably
six thousand men,<a id="footnotetag29" name="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a> was hemmed in by vastly superior forces,
by land and by water. Its embarrassment, however, did
not last long. On the following morning Lord Howe appeared
and anchored off Point Judith, seven miles from the entrance
to the Bay, and twelve from the position then occupied by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>
French fleet. He brought a stronger force than he had been
able to gather for the defence of New York, having now one
74, seven 64's, and five 50's, in all thirteen of the line, besides
several smaller vessels; but he still was greatly inferior to
opponent, by any rational mode of naval reckoning.</p>

<p>Howe's energies in New York had not been confined to
preparations for resisting the entrance of the enemy, nor
did they cease with the latter's departure. When he first
arrived there from Philadelphia, he had hastened to get
his ships ready for sea, a pre-occupation which somewhat,
but not unduly, delayed their taking their positions at Sandy
Hook. Two, for instance, had been at the watering-place
when the approach of the French was signalled. Owing to
this diligence, no time was lost by his fault when the new
destination of the enemy was made known to him, on the
28th or 29th of July, by the arrival of the <i>Raisonnable</i>, 64,<a id="footnotetag30" name="footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30"><sup>30</sup></a>
from Halifax. This ship narrowly escaped the French fleet,
having passed it on the evening of the 27th, steering for Rhode
Island. The <i>Renown</i>, 50, which on the 26th had reached New
York from the West Indies, had a similar close shave,
having sailed unnoticed through the rear of the enemy
the night before. Besides these two, Howe was joined also
by the <i>Centurion</i>, 50, from Halifax, and by the <i>Cornwall</i>, 74;
the latter, which crossed the bar on the 30th, being the first
of Byron's fleet to reach New York. The three others
belonged to Howe's own squadron. For the two Halifax
ships which helped to make this most welcome reinforcement,
the Admiral was indebted to the diligence of the
officer there commanding, who hurried them away as soon
as he learned of d'Estaing's appearance on the coast. The
opportuneness of their arrival attracted notice. "Had they
appeared a few days sooner," says a contemporary narrative,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>
"either they must have been prevented from forming a
junction with our squadron, and forced again to sea, or we
should have had the mortification to see them increase the
triumph of our enemy."</p>

<p>On the 1st of August, forty-eight hours after the <i>Cornwall</i>
had come in from a stormy passage of fifty-two days, the
squadron was ready for sea, and Howe attempted to sail;
but the wind hauled foul immediately after the signal to
weigh had been made. It did not become fair at the hour
of high water, when alone heavy ships could cross the bar,
until the morning of the 6th. "Rhode Island was of such
importance," says the narrator already quoted, "<i>and the
fate of so large a portion of the British army as formed the
garrison was of such infinite consequence to the general cause</i>,
that it was imagined the Admiral would not lose a moment in
making some attempt for their relief." He had learned of
the detachments made from the French fleet, and hoped that
some advantage might be taken of this division. In short,
he went, as was proper and incumbent on him in such critical
circumstances, to take a great risk, in hope of a favourable
chance offering. On the 9th, as before stated, he anchored off
Point Judith, and opened communications with the garrison,
from which he learned the events that had so far occurred,
and also that the enemy was well provided with craft of all
kinds to make a descent upon any part of the Island.</p>

<p>As deGrasse at Yorktown, when rumour announced the
approach of a British fleet, was deterred only by the most
urgent appeals of Washington from abandoning his control
of the Chesapeake, essential to the capture of Cornwallis,
so now d'Estaing, in Narragansett Bay, was unwilling to
keep his place, in face of Howe's greatly inferior squadron.<a id="footnotetag31" name="footnotetag31"></a><a href="#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span>
The influence exerted upon these two admirals by the mere
approach of a hostile fleet, when decisive advantages depended
upon their holding their ground, may be cited plausibly in
support of the most extreme view of the effect of a "fleet
in being;" but the instances also, when the conditions
are analysed, will suggest the question: Is such effect always
legitimate, inherent in the existence of the fleet itself, or does
it not depend often upon the characteristics of the man
affected? The contemporary British narrative of these
events in Narragansett Bay, after reciting the various obstacles
and the inferiority of the British squadron, says:
"The most skilful officers were therefore of opinion that the
Vice-Admiral could not risk an attack; and it appears by his
Lordship's public letter that this was also his own opinion:
under such circumstances, he judged it was impracticable to
afford the General any essential relief." In both these
instances, the admirals concerned were impelled to sacrifice
the almost certain capture, not of a mere position, but of a
decisive part of the enemy's organised forces, by the mere
possibility of action; by the moral effect produced by a
fleet greatly inferior to their own, which in neither case would
have attacked, as things stood. What does this prove?</p>

<p>Immediately upon Howe's appearance, the French seamen
who had landed the day before on Conanicut were recalled
to their ships. The next morning, August 10, at 7 A.M., the
wind came out strong at north-east, which is exceptional at
that season. D'Estaing at once put to sea, cutting the
cables in his haste. In two hours he was outside, steering
for the enemy. Howe, of course, retired at once; his inferiority<a id="footnotetag32" name="footnotetag32"></a><a href="#footnote32"><sup>32</sup></a>
did not permit an engagement except on his own
terms. To insure these, he needed the weather-gage, the
offensive position of that day, which by keeping south he
expected to gain, when the usual wind from that quarter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>
should set in. The French Admiral had the same object,
hoping to crush his agile opponent; and, as the sea breeze
from south-west did not make that day, he succeeded in
keeping the advantage with which he had started, despite
Howe's skill. At nightfall both fleets were still steering to
the southward, on the port tack, the French five or six
miles in the rear of the British, with the wind variable at east.
The same course was maintained throughout the night, the
French gradually overhauling the British, and becoming
visible at 3 A.M. of the 11th. By Howe's dispatch, they
bore in the morning, at an hour not specified, east-north-east,
which would be nearly abeam, but somewhat more
distant than the night before, having apparently kept closer
to the wind, which by this had steadied at east-north-east.</p>

<p>In the course of the day Howe shifted his flag from the
<i>Eagle</i>, 64, to the <i>Apollo</i>, 32, and placed himself between the
two fleets, the better to decide the movements of his own.
Finding it impossible to gain the weather-gage, and unwilling,
probably, to be drawn too far from Rhode Island, he now
made a wide circle with the fleet by a succession of changes
of course: at 8 A.M. to south, then to south-west and west,
until finally, at 1.30 P.M., the ships were steering north-west;
always in line of battle. The French Admiral seems to have
followed this movement cautiously, on an outer circle but
with a higher speed, so that from east-north-east in the
morning, which, as the fleets were then heading, would be
on the starboard side of the British, abreast and to windward,
at 4 P.M. the French bore south-south-east, which would be
somewhat on the port quarter, or nearly astern but to
leeward. At this time their van was estimated by Howe to
be two or three miles from the British rear, and, according
to his reading of their man&oelig;uvres, d'Estaing was forming his
line for the same tack as the British, with a view of "engaging
the British squadron to leeward," whereby he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>
obtain over it the advantage of using the lower-deck guns, the
wind and sea having become much heavier. As the French
Admiral, in this new disposition, had put his heaviest ships
in the van, and his line was nearly in the wake of the
British, Howe inferred an attack upon his rear. He
therefore ordered his heaviest ship, the <i>Cornwall</i>, 74, to go
there from the centre, exchanging places with the <i>Centurion</i>,
50, and at the same time signalled the fleet to close <i>to the
centre</i>,&mdash;a detail worth remembering in view of Rodney's
frustrated man&oelig;uvre of April 17th, 1780. It now remained
simply to await firmly the moment when the French
should have covered the intervening ground, and brought
to action so much of his rear as d'Estaing saw fit to engage;
the conditions of the sea favoring the speed of the bulkier
ships that composed the hostile fleet. The latter, however,
soon abandoned the attempt, and "bore away to the southward,
apparently from the state of the weather, which, by
the wind freshening much, with frequent rain, was now
rendered very unfavorable for engaging." It may be
added that the hour was very late for beginning an action.
At sundown the British were under close-reefed topsails,
and the sea such that Howe was unable to return to the <i>Eagle</i>.<a id="footnotetag33" name="footnotetag33"></a><a href="#footnote33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>The wind now increased to great violence, and a severe
storm raged on the coast until the evening of the 13th,
throwing the two fleets into confusion, scattering the ships,
and causing numerous disasters. The <i>Apollo</i> lost her foremast,
and sprung the mainmast, on the night of the 12th.
The next day only two British ships of the line and three
smaller vessels were in sight of their Admiral. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>
weather moderated, Howe went on board the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>, 44,
and thence to the <i>Centurion</i>, 50, with which he "proceeded to
the southward, and on the 15th discovered ten sail of the
French squadron, some at anchor in the sea, about twenty-five
leagues east from Cape May."<a id="footnotetag34" name="footnotetag34"></a><a href="#footnote34"><sup>34</sup></a> Leaving there the
<i>Centurion</i>, to direct to New York any of Byron's ships
that might come on the coast, he departed thither himself
also, and on the evening of the 17th rejoined the squadron
off Sandy Hook, the appointed rendezvous. Many injuries
had been received by the various ships, but they were mostly
of a minor character; and on the 22d the fleet again put to
sea in search of the enemy.</p>

<p>The French had suffered much more severely. The flagship
<i>Languedoc</i>, 90, had carried away her bowsprit, all her
lower masts followed it overboard, and her tiller also was
broken, rendering the rudder unserviceable. The <i>Marseillais</i>,
74, lost her foremast and bowsprit. In the dispersal of the
two fleets that followed the gale, each of these crippled vessels,
on the evening of the 13th, encountered singly a British 50-gun
ship; the <i>Languedoc</i> being attacked by the <i>Renown</i>, and
the <i>Marseillais</i> by the <i>Preston</i>. The conditions in each instance
were distinctly favourable to the smaller combatant;
but both unfortunately withdrew at nightfall, making the
mistake of postponing to to-morrow a chance which they had
no certainty would exist after to-day. When morning
dawned, other French ships appeared, and the opportunity
passed away. The British <i>Isis</i>, 50, also was chased and
overtaken by the <i>C&#233;sar</i>, 74. In the action which ensued, the
French ship's wheel was shot away, and she retired;&mdash;two
other British vessels, one of the line, being in sight. The latter
are not mentioned in the British accounts, and both sides
claimed the advantage in this drawn action. The French captain lost an arm.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>

<p>After making temporary repairs, at the anchorage where
Howe saw them on the 15th of August, the French fleet had
proceeded again towards Newport. It was in the course of
this passage that they were seen by Byron's flagship<a id="footnotetag35" name="footnotetag35"></a><a href="#footnote35"><sup>35</sup></a> on the
18th, to the southward of Long Island. The <i>Experiment</i>,
50, which Howe had sent to reconnoitre Narragansett Bay,
was chased by them into Long Island Sound, and only reached
New York by the East River; being the first ship of the line
or 50-gun ship that ever passed through Hell Gate. On the
20th d'Estaing communicated with General Sullivan, the
commander of the American land forces on Rhode Island;
but it was only to tell him that in his own opinion, and in
that of a council of war, the condition of the squadron necessitated
going to Boston to refit. Whatever may be thought of
the propriety of this decision, its seriousness can be best
understood from the report sent by Pigot to Howe. "The
rebels had advanced their batteries within fifteen hundred
yards of the British works. He was under no apprehensions
from any of their attempts in front; but, should the French
fleet come in, it would make an alarming change. Troops
might be landed and advanced in his rear; and in that case
he could not answer for the consequences." Disregarding
Sullivan's entreaties that he would remain, d'Estaing sailed
next day for Boston, which he reached on August 28th. On
the 31st the indefatigable Howe came in sight; but the French
had worked actively in the three days. Forty-nine guns,
18 and 24-pounders, with six mortars, were already in position
covering the anchorage; and "the French squadron, far
from fearing an attack, desired it eagerly."<a id="footnotetag36" name="footnotetag36"></a><a href="#footnote36"><sup>36</sup></a> The withdrawal
of the French fleet from Rhode Island was followed by that
of the American troops from before Newport.</p>

<p>Howe had quitted New York the instant he heard of
d'Estaing's reappearance off Rhode Island. He took with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>
him the same number of vessels as before,&mdash;thirteen of the
line,&mdash;the <i>Monmouth</i>, 64, of Byron's squadron, having
arrived and taken the place of the <i>Isis</i>, crippled in her late
action. Before reaching Newport, he learned that the
French had started for Boston. He hoped that they would
find it necessary to go outside George's Bank, and that he
might intercept them by following the shorter road inside.
In this he was disappointed, as has been seen, and the
enemy's position was now too strong for attack. The
French retreat to Boston closed the naval campaign of 1778
in North American waters.</p>

</div>

<p>The inability or unwillingness of d'Estaing to renew the
enterprise against Rhode Island accords the indisputable
triumph in this campaign to Howe,&mdash;an honour he must
share, and doubtless would have shared gladly, with his supporters
in general. That his fleet, for the most part two years
from home, in a country without dockyards, should have been
able to take the sea within ten days after the gale, while
their opponents, just from France, yet with three months' sea
practice, were so damaged that they had to abandon the field
and all the splendid prospects of Rhode Island,&mdash;as they
already had allowed to slip the chance at New York,&mdash;shows
a decisive superiority in the British officers and crews.
The incontestable merits of the rank and file, however, must
not be permitted to divert attention from the great qualities
of the leader, but for which the best material would have
been unavailing. The conditions were such as to elicit to the
utmost Howe's strongest qualities,&mdash;firmness, endurance,
uninterrupted persistence rather than celerity, great professional
skill, ripened by constant reflection and ready at
an instant's call. Not brilliant in intellect, perhaps, but
absolutely clear, and replete with expedients to meet every
probable contingency, Howe exhibited an equable, unflagging
energy, which was his greatest characteristic, and which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>
eminently fitted him for the task of checkmating an enemy's
every move&mdash;for a purely defensive campaign. He was
always on hand and always ready; for he never wearied, and
he knew his business. To great combinations he was perhaps
unequal. At all events, such are not associated with his
name. The distant scene he did not see; but step by step
he saw his way with absolute precision, and followed it with
unhesitating resolution. With a force inferior throughout,
to have saved, in one campaign, the British fleet, New
York, and Rhode Island, with the entire British army,
which was divided between those two stations and dependent
upon the sea, is an achievement unsurpassed in the annals
of naval defensive warfare. It may be added that his
accomplishment is the measure of his adversary's deficiencies.</p>

<p>Howe's squadron had been constituted in 1776 with reference
to the colonial struggle only, and to shallow water,
and therefore was composed, very properly, of cruisers, and
of ships of the line of the smaller classes; there being several
fifties, and nothing larger than a sixty-four. When war with
France threatened, the Ministry, having long warning, committed
an unpardonable fault in allowing such a force to be
confronted by one so superior as that which sailed from
Toulon, in April, 1778. This should have been stopped on
its way, or, failing that, its arrival in America should have
been preceded by a British reinforcement. As it was, the
government was saved from a tremendous disaster only by
the efficiency of its Admiral and the inefficiency of his antagonist.
As is not too uncommon, gratitude was swamped
by the instinct of self-preservation from the national wrath,
excited by this, and by other simultaneous evidences of
neglect. An attempt was made to disparage Howe's conduct,
and to prove that his force was even superior to that of
the French, by adding together the guns in all his ships, disregarding
their classes, or by combining groups of his small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
vessels against d'Estaing's larger units. The instrument
of the attack was a naval officer, of some rank but slender
professional credit, who at this most opportune moment
underwent a political conversion, which earned him employment
on the one hand, and the charge of apostasy on
the other. For this kind of professional arithmetic, Howe
felt and expressed just and utter contempt. Two and two
make four in a primer, but in the field they may make three,
or they may make five. Not to speak of the greater defensive
power of heavy ships, nor of the concentration of
their fire, the unity of direction under one captain possesses
here also that importance which has caused unity of command
and of effort to be recognised as the prime element in
military efficiency, from the greatest things to the smallest.
Taken together, the three elements&mdash;greater defensive power,
concentration of fire, and unity of direction&mdash;constitute a
decisive and permanent argument in favor of big ships, in
Howe's days as in our own. Doubtless, now, as then, there
is a limit; most arguments can be pushed to an <i>absurdum</i>,
intellectual or practical. To draw a line is always hard;
but, if we cannot tell just where the line has been passed we
can recognise that one ship is much too big, while another
certainly is not. Between the two an approximation to an
exact result can be made.</p>

<p>On his return to New York on September 11th, Howe
found there Rear-Admiral Hyde Parker<a id="footnotetag37" name="footnotetag37"></a><a href="#footnote37"><sup>37</sup></a> with six ships of the
line of Byron's squadron. Considering his task now accomplished,
Howe decided to return to England, in virtue of
a permission granted some time before at his own request.
The duty against the Americans, lately his fellow-countrymen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>
had been always distasteful to him, although he did
not absolutely refuse to undertake it, as did Admiral Keppel.
The entrance of France into the quarrel, and the coming of
d'Estaing, refreshed the spirits of the veteran, who moreover
scorned to abandon his command in the face of such odds.
Now, with the British positions secure, and superiority of
force insured for the time being, he gladly turned over his
charge and sailed for home; burning against the Admiralty
with a wrath common to most of the distinguished seamen
of that war. He was not employed afloat again until a
change of Ministry took place, in 1782.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE NAVAL WAR IN EUROPE. THE BATTLE OF USHANT<br />

1778</h3>


<p>During the same two months that saw the
contest between d'Estaing and Howe in America
the only encounter between nearly equal fleets
in 1778 took place in European waters. Admiral
Keppel, having returned to Spithead after the affair
between the <i>Belle Poule</i> and the <i>Arethusa</i>,<a id="footnotetag38" name="footnotetag38"></a><a href="#footnote38"><sup>38</sup></a> again put to sea
on the 9th of July, with a force increased to thirty ships
of the line. He had been mortified by the necessity of avoiding
action, and of even retiring into port, with the inadequate
numbers before under his command, and his mind was
fixed now to compel an engagement, if he met the French.</p>

<p>The Brest fleet also put to sea, the day before Keppel,
under the command of Admiral the Comte d'Orvilliers. It
contained thirty-two ships of the line. Of these, three&mdash;64,
a 60, and a 50&mdash;were not considered fit for the
line of battle, which was thus reduced to twenty-nine sail,
carrying 2098 guns. To these the British opposed an aggregate
of 2278; but comparison by this means only is very
rough. Not only the sizes of the guns, but the classes and
weight of the vessels need to be considered. In the particular
instance the matter is of little importance; the action
being indecisive, and credit depending upon man&oelig;uvres
rather than upon fighting.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>

<p>The French admiral was hampered by vacillating instructions,
reflections of the unstable impulses which swayed the
Ministry. Whatever his personal wishes, he felt that he
was expected to avoid action, unless under very favourable
circumstances. At the moment of sailing he wrote: "Since
you leave me free to continue my cruise, I will not bring the
fleet back to Brest, unless by positive orders, until I have
fulfilled the month at sea mentioned in my instructions, and
known to all the captains. Till then I will not fly before
Admiral Keppel, whatever his strength; only, if I know him
to be too superior, I will avoid a disproportionate action as
well as I can; but if the enemy really seeks to force it, it will
be very hard to shun." These words explain his conduct
through the next few days.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of July 23d the two fleets sighted each
other, about a hundred miles west of Ushant, the French
being then to leeward. Towards sunset, they were standing
south-west, with the wind at west-north-west, and bore
north-east from the enemy, who were lying-to, heads to the
northward. The British remaining nearly motionless
throughout the night, and the wind shifting, d'Orvilliers
availed himself of the conditions to press to windward, and
in the morning was found to bear north-west from his opponent.<a id="footnotetag39" name="footnotetag39"></a><a href="#footnote39"><sup>39</sup></a>
Their relative positions satisfied both admirals for
the moment; for Keppel found himself interposed between
Brest and the French, while d'Orvilliers, though surrendering
the advantage of open retreat to his port, had made it
possible, by getting the weather-gage, to fulfil his promise to
keep the sea and yet to avoid action. Two of his ships,
however, the <i>Duc de Bourgogne</i>, 80, and a 74, were still
to leeward, not only of their own main body, but also of
the British. Keppel sent chasers after them, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>
expressed purpose of compelling d'Orvilliers to action in their
support,<a id="footnotetag40" name="footnotetag40"></a><a href="#footnote40"><sup>40</sup></a> and it was believed by the British that they were
forced to return to Brest, to avoid being cut off. They
certainly quitted their fleet, which was thus reduced to
twenty-seven effective sail. From this time until July 27th
the wind continued to the westward, and the wariness of the
French admiral baffled all his antagonist's efforts to get
within range. Keppel, having no doubts as to what was
expected of him, pursued vigorously, watching his chance.
On the morning of July 27th the two fleets [Fig 1, AA,
AA], were from six to ten miles apart, wind south-west, both
on the port tack,<a id="footnotetag41" name="footnotetag41"></a><a href="#footnote41"><sup>41</sup></a> steering north-west; the French dead to
windward, in line ahead. The British were in bow-and-quarter
line. In this formation, when exact, the ships of
a fleet were nearly abreast each other; so ranged, however,
that if they tacked all at the same time they would be at
once in line of battle ahead close to the wind,&mdash;the fighting
order.<a id="footnotetag42" name="footnotetag42"></a><a href="#footnote42"><sup>42</sup></a> Both fleets were irregularly formed, the
British especially so; for Keppel rightly considered that he
would not accomplish his purpose, if he were pedantic concerning
the order of his going. He had therefore signalled a
"General Chase," which, by permitting much individual
freedom of movement, facilitated the progress of the whole
body. At daylight, the division commanded by Sir Hugh
Palliser&mdash;the right wing, as then heading&mdash;had dropped
astern [R]; and at 5.30 A.M. the signal was made to seven of
its fastest sailers to chase to windward, to get farther to windward
by pressing sail, the object being so to place them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>
relatively to the main body, as to support the latter, if an
opportunity for action should offer.</p>

<p>At 9 A.M. the French admiral, wishing to approach the
enemy and to see more clearly, ordered his fleet to wear in
succession,&mdash;to countermarch. As the van ships went
round (b) under this signal, they had to steer off the wind
(be), parallel to their former line, on which those following
them still were, until they reached the point to which the
rear ship meantime had advanced (c), when they could again
haul to the wind. This caused a loss of ground to leeward,
but not more than d'Orvilliers could afford, as things stood.
Just after he had fairly committed himself to the man&oelig;uvre,
the wind hauled to the southward two points,<a id="footnotetag43" name="footnotetag43"></a><a href="#footnote43"><sup>43</sup></a> from south-west
to south-south-west, which favoured the British, allowing
them to head more nearly towards the enemy (BB). The shift
also threw the bows of the French off the line they were
following, deranging their order. Keppel therefore continued
on the port tack, until all the French (BB), were on the starboard,
and at 10.15, being nearly in their wake, he ordered
his own ships to tack together (dd), which would bring them
into line ahead on the same tack as the French; that is,
having the wind on the same side. This put the British in
column,<a id="footnotetag44" name="footnotetag44"></a><a href="#footnote44"><sup>44</sup></a> still to leeward, but nearly astern of the enemy
and following (CC). At this moment a thick rain-squall
came up, concealing the fleets one from another for three
quarters of an hour. With the squall the wind shifted back
to southwest, favouring the British on this tack, as it had on
the other, and enabling them to lay up for the enemy's rear
after which (French BB) they were standing and could now
bring to action. When the weather cleared, at 11, the French
were seen to have gone about again, all the ships together, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>
were still in the confusion of a partly executed man&oelig;uvre (CC).
Their admiral had doubtless recognised, from the change of
wind, and from the direction of the enemy when last visible,
that an encounter could not be avoided. If he continued
on the starboard tack, the van of the pursuing enemy,
whose resolve to force battle could not be misunderstood,
would overtake his rear ships, engaging as many of them as
he might choose. By resuming the port tack, the heads of the
columns would meet, and the fleets pass in opposite directions,
on equal terms as regarded position; because all the
French would engage, and not only a part of their rear.
Therefore he had ordered his ships to go about, all at the
same time; thus forming column again rapidly, but reversing
the order so that the rear became the van.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/86.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/86.jpg" alt="" /></a>
D'Orvilliers and Keppel, off Ushant, July 27, 1778<br />
Figure 1</div>

<p>Keppel so far had made no signal for the line of battle, nor
did he now. Recognising from the four days' chase that
his enemy was avoiding action, he judged correctly that he
should force it, even at some risk. It was not the time for
a drill-master, nor a parade. Besides, thanks to the morning
signal for the leewardly ships to chase, these, forming the
rear of the disorderly column in which he was advancing,
were now well to windward, able therefore to support their
comrades, if needful, as well as to attack the enemy. In
short, practically the whole force was coming into action,
although much less regularly than might have been desired.
What was to follow was a rough-and-ready fight, but it was
all that could be had, and better than nothing. Keppel
therefore simply made the signal for battle, and that just
as the firing began. The collision was so sudden that the
ships at first had not their colours flying.</p>

<p>The French also, although their man&oelig;uvres had been more
methodical, were in some confusion. It is not given to a
body of thirty ships, of varying qualities, to attain perfection
of movement in a fortnight of sea practice. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>
change of wind had precipitated an action, which one admiral
had been seeking, and the other shunning; but each had to
meet it with such shift as he could. The British (CC) being
close-hauled, the French (CC), advancing on a parallel line,
were four points<a id="footnotetag45" name="footnotetag45"></a><a href="#footnote45"><sup>45</sup></a> off the wind. Most of their ships, therefore,
could have gone clear to windward of their opponents,
but the fact that the latter could reach some of the leaders
compelled the others to support them. As d'Orvilliers had
said, it was hard to avoid an enemy resolute to fight. The
leading three French vessels<a id="footnotetag46" name="footnotetag46"></a><a href="#footnote46"><sup>46</sup></a> (e) hauled their wind, in obedience
to the admiral's signal to form the line of battle, which
means a close-hauled line. The effect of this was to draw
them gradually away from the hostile line, taking them out
of range of the British centre and rear. This, if imitated
by their followers, would render the affair even more partial
and indecisive than such passing by usually was. The
fourth French ship began the action, opening fire soon after
eleven. The vessels of the opposing fleets surged by under
short canvas, (D), firing as opportunity offered, but necessarily
much handicapped by smoke, which prevented the clear
sight of an enemy, and caused anxiety lest an unseen friend
might receive a broadside. "The distance between the
<i>Formidable</i>, 90, (Palliser's flagship) and the <i>Egmont</i>, 74, was
so short," testified Captain John Laforey, whose three-decker,
the <i>Ocean</i>, 90, was abreast and outside this interval, "that
it was with difficulty I could keep betwixt them to engage,
without firing upon them, and I was once very near on board
the <i>Egmont</i>,"&mdash;next ahead of the <i>Ocean</i>. The <i>Formidable</i>
kept her mizzen topsail aback much of the time, to deaden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>
her way, to make the needed room ahead for the <i>Ocean</i>, and
also to allow the rear ships to close. "At a quarter past one,"
testified Captain Maitland of the <i>Elizabeth</i>, 74, "we were
very close behind the <i>Formidable</i>, and a midshipman upon
the poop called out that there was a ship coming on board
on the weatherbow. I put the helm up,... and found,
when the smoke cleared away, I was shot up under the <i>Formidable's</i>
lee. She was then engaged with the two last ships
in the French fleet, and, as I could not fire at them without
firing through the <i>Formidable</i>, I was obliged to shoot on."<a id="footnotetag47" name="footnotetag47"></a><a href="#footnote47"><sup>47</sup></a>
Captain Bazely, of the <i>Formidable</i>, says of the same incident,
"The <i>Formidable</i> did at the time of action bear up to one of
the enemy's ships, to avoid being aboard of her, whose jib
boom nearly touched the main topsail weather leech of the
<i>Formidable</i>. I thought we could not avoid being on board."</p>

<p>Contrary to the usual result, the loss of the rear division,
in killed and wounded, was heaviest, nearly equalling the
aggregate of the two others.<a id="footnotetag48" name="footnotetag48"></a><a href="#footnote48"><sup>48</sup></a> This was due to the morning
signal to chase to windward, which brought these ships
closer than their leaders. As soon as the British van, ten
ships, had passed the French rear, its commander, Vice-Admiral
Sir Robert Harland, anticipating Keppel's wishes,
signalled it to go about and follow the enemy (Fig. 2, V).
As the French column was running free, these ships, when
about, fetched to windward of its wake. When the <i>Victory</i>
drew out of the fire, at 1 P.M., Keppel also made a similar
signal, and attempted to wear (c), the injuries to his rigging
not permitting tacking; but caution was needed in man&oelig;uvring
across the bows of the following ships, and it was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>
till 2 P.M., that the <i>Victory</i> was about on the other tack
(Fig. 2, C), heading after the French. At this time, 2 P.M.,
just before or just after wearing, the signal for battle was
hauled down, and that for the line of battle was hoisted.
The object of the latter was to re-form the order, and the
first was discontinued, partly because no longer needed,
chiefly that it might not seem to contradict the urgent call for a re-formation.</p>

<p>At this time six or seven of Harland's division were on the
weather bow of the <i>Victory</i>, to windward (westward), but
a little ahead, and standing like her after the French; all
on the port tack (Fig. 2). None of the centre division succeeded
in joining the flagship at once. At 2.30 Palliser's
ship, the <i>Formidable</i> (R), on the starboard tack, passed the
<i>Victory</i> to leeward, apparently the last of the fleet out of
action. A half-hour after this the <i>Victory</i> had been joined
by three of the centre, which were following her in close
order, the van remaining in the same relative position.
Astern of these two groups from van and centre were a
number of other ships in various degrees of confusion,&mdash;some
going about, some trying to come up, others completely
disabled. Especially, there was in the south-south-east,
therefore well to leeward, a cluster of four or five British
vessels, evidently temporarily incapable of man&oelig;uvring.</p>

<p>This was the situation which met the eye of the French
admiral, scanning the field as the smoke drove away. The
disorder of the British, which originated in the general chase,
had increased through the hurry of the man&oelig;uvres succeeding
the squall, and culminated in the conditions just described.
It was an inevitable result of a military exigency confronted
by a fleet only recently equipped. The French, starting from
a better formation, had come out in better shape. But, after
all, it seems difficult wholly to remedy the disadvantage of
a policy essentially defensive; and d'Orvilliers' next order,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>
though well conceived, was resultless. At 1 P.M.<a id="footnotetag49" name="footnotetag49"></a><a href="#footnote49"><sup>49</sup></a> he signalled
his fleet to wear in succession, and form the line of battle on
the starboard tack (Fig. 2, F). This signal was not seen by
the leading ship, which should have begun the movement.
The junior French admiral, in the fourth ship from the van,
at length went about, and spoke the flagship, to know what
was the Commander-in-Chief's desire. D'Orvilliers explained
that he wished to pass along the enemy's fleet from end to
end, to <i>leeward</i>, because in its disordered state there was a
fair promise of advantage, and by going to leeward&mdash;presenting
his weather side to the enemy&mdash;he could use the
weather lower-deck guns, whereas, in the then state of the
sea, the lee lower ports could not be opened. Thus explained,
the movement was executed, but the favourable moment
had passed. It was not till 2.30 that the man&oelig;uvre was evident to the British.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/90.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/90.jpg" alt="" /></a>
D'Orvilliers and Keppel, off Ushant, July 27, 1778<br />
Figures 2 and 3</div>

<p>As soon as Keppel recognised his opponent's intention, he
wore the <i>Victory</i> again, (d), a few minutes after 3 P.M., and stood
slowly down, on the starboard tack <i>off the wind</i>, towards his
crippled ships in the south-south-east, keeping aloft the signal
for the line of battle, which commanded every manageable
ship to get to her station (Fig. 3, C). As this deliberate
movement was away from the enemy, (F), Palliser tried afterwards
to fix upon it the stigma of flight,&mdash;a preposterous
extravagancy. Harland put his division about at once and
joined the Admiral. On this tack his station was ahead of
the <i>Victory</i>, but in consequence of a message from Keppel
he fell in behind her, to cover the rear until Palliser's division
could repair damage and take their places. At 4 P.M. Harland's
division was in the line. Palliser's ships, as they completed
refitting, ranged themselves before or behind his flagship;
their captains considering, as they testified, that they took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>
station from their divisional commander, and not from the
ship of the Commander-in-Chief. There was formed thus,
on the weather quarter of the <i>Victory</i>, and a mile or two distant,
a separate line of ships, constituting on this tack the
proper rear of the fleet, and dependent for initiative on
Palliser's flagship (Fig. 3, R). At 5 P.M. Keppel sent word
by a frigate to Palliser to hasten into the line, as he was only
waiting for him to renew the action, the French now having
completed their man&oelig;uvre. They had not attacked, as
they might have done, but had drawn up under the lee of
the British, their van abreast the latter's centre. At the
same time Harland was directed to move to his proper position
in the van, which he at once did (Fig. 3, V). Palliser
made no movement, and Keppel with extraordinary&mdash;if
not culpable&mdash;forbearance refrained from summoning the
rear ships into line by their individual pennants. This he
at last did about 7 P.M., signalling specifically to each of the
vessels then grouped with Palliser, (except his own flagship),
to leave the latter and take their posts in the line. This
was accordingly done, but it was thought then to be too late
to renew the action. At daylight the next morning, only
three French ships were in sight from the decks; but the
main body could be seen in the south-east from some of the
mastheads, and was thought to be from fifteen to twenty miles distant.</p>

<p>Though absolutely indecisive, this was a pretty smart
skirmish; the British loss being 133 killed and 373 wounded,
that of the French 161 killed and 513 wounded. The general
result would appear to indicate that the French, in accordance
with their usual policy, had fired to cripple their enemy's
spars and rigging, the motive-power. This would be consistent
with d'Orvilliers' avowed purpose of avoiding action
except under favourable circumstances. As the smoke
thickened and confusion increased, the fleets had got closer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span>
together, and, whatever the intention, many shot found their
way to the British hulls. Nevertheless, as the returns show,
the number of men hit among the French was to the British
nearly as 7 to 5. On the other hand, it is certain that the
man&oelig;uvring power of the French after the action was greater
than that of the British.</p>

<p>Both sides claimed the advantage. This was simply a
point of honour, or of credit, for material advantage accrued
to neither. Keppel had succeeded in forcing d'Orvilliers
to action against his will; d'Orvilliers, by a well-judged
evolution, had retained a superiority of man&oelig;uvring power
after the engagement. Had his next signal been promptly
obeyed, he might have passed again by the British fleet, in
fairly good order, before it re-formed, and concentrated his
fire on the more leewardly of its vessels. Even under the
delay, it was distinctly in his power to renew the fight;
and that he did not do so forfeits all claim to victory. Not
to speak of the better condition of the French ships, Keppel,
by running off the wind, had given his opponent full opportunity
to reach his fleet and to attack. Instead of so doing,
d'Orvilliers drew up under the British lee, out of range, and
offered battle; a gallant defiance, but to a crippled foe.</p>

<p>Time was thus given to the British to refit their ships
sufficiently to bear down again. This the French admiral
should not have permitted. He should have attacked
promptly, or else have retreated; to windward, or to leeward,
as seemed most expedient. Under the conditions, it
was not good generalship to give the enemy time, and to
await his pleasure. Keppel, on the other hand, being granted
this chance, should have renewed the fight; and here arose
the controversy which set all England by the ears, and may
be said to have immortalised this otherwise trivial incident.
Palliser's division was to windward from 4 to 7 P.M., while
the signals were flying to form line of battle, and to bear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>
down in the Admiral's wake; and Keppel alleged that, had
these been obeyed by 6 P.M., he would have renewed the battle,
having still over two hours of daylight. It has been stated
already that, besides the signals, a frigate brought Palliser
word that the Admiral was waiting only for him.</p>

<p>The immediate dispute is of slight present interest, except
as an historical link in the fighting development of the British
Navy; and only this historical significance justifies more
than a passing mention. In 1778 men's minds were still
full of Byng's execution in 1757, and of the Mathews and
Lestock affair in 1744, which had materially influenced
Byng in his action off Minorca. Keppel repeatedly spoke
of himself as on trial for his life; and he had been a member
of Byng's court-martial. The gist of the charges against
him, preferred by Palliser, was that he attacked in the first
instance without properly forming his line, for which Mathews
had been censured; and, secondly, that by not renewing
the action after the first pass-by, and by wearing away from
the French fleet, he had not done his utmost to "take, sink,
burn, and destroy." This had been the charge on which
Byng was shot. Keppel, besides his justifying reasons for
his course in general, alleged and proved his full intention to
attack again, had not Palliser failed to come into line, a
delinquency the same as that of Lestock, which contributed to Mathew's ruin.</p>

<p>In other words, men's minds were breaking away from,
but had not thrown off completely, the tyranny of the Order
of Battle,&mdash;one of the worst of tyrannies, because founded
on truth. Absolute error, like a whole lie, is open to speedy
detection; half-truths are troublesome. The Order of Battle<a id="footnotetag50" name="footnotetag50"></a><a href="#footnote50"><sup>50</sup></a>
was an admirable servant and a most objectionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>
despot. Mathews, in despair over a recalcitrant second,
cast off the yoke, engaged with part of his force, was ill supported
and censured; Lestock escaping. Byng, considering
this, and being a pedant by nature, would not break his
line; the enemy slipped away, Minorca surrendered, and he
was shot. In Keppel's court-martial, twenty-eight out of
the thirty captains who had been in the line were summoned
as witnesses. Most of them swore that if Keppel had chased
in line of battle that day, there could have been no action,
and the majority of them cordially approved his course;
but there was evidently an undercurrent still of dissent, and
especially in the rear ships, where there had been some of the
straggling inevitable in such movements. Their commanders
therefore had uncomfortable experience of the lack of mutual
support, which the line of battle was meant to insure.</p>

<p>Another indication of still surviving pedantry was the obligation
felt in the rear ships to take post about their own
admiral, and to remain there when the signals for the line
of battle, and to bear down in the admiral's wake, were
flying. Thus Palliser's own inaction, to whatever cause due,
paralysed the six or eight sail with him; but it appears to
the writer that Keppel was seriously remiss in not summoning
those ships by their own pennants, as soon as he began to
distrust the purposes of the Vice-Admiral, instead of delaying
doing so till 7 P.M., as he did. It is a curious picture presented
to us by the evidence. The Commander-in-Chief, with his
staff and the captain of the ship, fretting and fuming on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>
<i>Victory's</i> quarter-deck; the signals flying which have been
mentioned; Harland's division getting into line ahead; and
four points on the weather quarter, only two miles distant,
so that "every gun and port could be counted," a group of
seven or eight sail, among them the flag of the third in command,
apparently indifferent spectators. The <i>Formidable's</i>
only sign of disability was the foretopsail unbent for four
hours,&mdash;a delay which, being unexplained, rather increased
than relieved suspicion, rife then throughout the Navy.
Palliser was a Tory, and had left the Board of Admiralty
to take his command. Keppel was so strong a Whig that
he would not serve against the Americans; and he evidently
feared that he was to be betrayed to his ruin.</p>

<p>Palliser's defence rested upon three principal points: (1),
that the signal for the line of battle was not seen on board
the <i>Formidable</i>; (2), that the signal to get into the Admiral's
wake was repeated by himself; (3), that his foremast was
wounded, and, moreover, found to be in such bad condition
that he feared to carry sail on it. As regards the first, the
signal was seen on board the <i>Ocean</i>, next astern of and "not
far from"<a id="footnotetag51" name="footnotetag51"></a><a href="#footnote51"><sup>51</sup></a> the <i>Formidable</i>; for the second, the Admiral
should have been informed of a disability by which a single
ship was neutralizing a division. The frigate that brought
Keppel's message could have carried back this. Thirdly, the
most damaging feature to Palliser's case was that he asserted
that, after coming out from under fire, he wore at once
towards the enemy; afterwards he wore back again. A ship
that thus wore twice before three o'clock, might have displayed
zeal and efficiency enough to run two miles, off the wind,<a id="footnotetag52" name="footnotetag52"></a><a href="#footnote52"><sup>52</sup></a>
at five, to support a fight. Deliberate treachery is impossible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>
To this writer the Vice-Admiral's behaviour seems that of a
man in a sulk, who will do only that which he can find no
excuses for neglecting. In such cases of sailing close, men
generally slip over the line into grievous wrong.</p>

<p>Keppel was cleared of all the charges preferred against
him; the accuser had not thought best to embody among
them the delay to recall the ships which his own example was
detaining. Against Palliser no specific charge was preferred,
but the Admiralty directed a general inquiry into his course
on the 27th of July. The court found his conduct "in many
instances highly exemplary and meritorious,"&mdash;he had
fought well,&mdash;"but reprehensible in not having acquainted
the Commander-in-Chief of his distress, which he might have
done either by the <i>Fox</i>, or other means which he had in his
power." Public opinion running strongly for Keppel, his
acquittal was celebrated with bonfires and illuminations in
London; the mob got drunk, smashed the windows of Palliser's
friends, wrecked Palliser's own house, and came near
to killing Palliser himself. The Admiralty, in 1780, made him
Governor of Greenwich Hospital.</p>

<p>On the 28th of July, the British and French being no longer
in sight of each other, Keppel, considering his fleet too injured
aloft to cruise near the French coast, kept away for
Plymouth, where he arrived on the 31st. Before putting to
sea again, he provided against a recurrence of the misdemeanor
of the 27th by a general order, that "in future the
Line is always to be taken from the Centre." Had this been
in force before, Palliser's captains would have taken station by
the Commander-in-Chief, and the <i>Formidable</i> would have been
left to windward by herself. At the same time Howe was
closing his squadron upon the centre in America; and Rodney,
two years later, experienced the ill-effects of distance
taken from the next ahead, when the leading ship of a
fleet disregarded an order.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>

<p>Although privately censuring Palliser's conduct, the Commander-in-Chief
made no official complaint, and it was not
until the matter got into the papers, through the talk of the
fleet, that the difficulty began which resulted in the trial of
both officers, early in the following year. After this, Keppel,
being dissatisfied with the Admiralty's treatment, intimated
his wish to give up the command. The order to strike his
flag was dated March 18th, 1779. He was not employed
afloat again, but upon the change of administration in 1782
he became First Lord of the Admiralty, and so remained, with
a brief intermission, until December, 1783.</p>

<p>It is perhaps necessary to mention that both British and
French asserted, and assert to this day, that the other party
abandoned the field.<a id="footnotetag53" name="footnotetag53"></a><a href="#footnote53"><sup>53</sup></a> The point is too trivial, in the author's
opinion, to warrant further discussion of an episode the historical
interest of which is very slight, though its professional
lessons are valuable. The British case had the advantage&mdash;through
the courts-martial&mdash;of the sworn testimony of
twenty to thirty captains, who agreed that the British kept
on the same tack under short sail throughout the night, and
that in the morning only three French ships were visible.
As far as known to the author, the French contention rests
only on the usual reports.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>OPERATIONS IN THE WEST INDIES, 1778-1779.
THE BRITISH INVASION OF GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA</h3>


<p>Conditions of season exerted great influence
upon the time and place of hostilities during
the maritime war of 1778; the opening scenes
of which, in Europe and in North America,
have just been narrated. In European seas it was realised
that naval enterprises by fleets, requiring evolutions by masses
of large vessels, were possible only in summer. Winter gales
scattered ships, impeded man&oelig;uvres, and made gun-fire
ineffective. The same consideration prevailed to limit activity
in North American waters to the summer; and complementary
to this was the fact that in the West Indies hurricanes
of excessive violence occurred from July to October.
The practice therefore was to transfer effort from one quarter
to the other in the Western Hemisphere, according to the season.</p>

<p>In the recent treaty with the United States, the King of
France had formally renounced all claim to acquire for himself
any part of the American continent then in possession
of Great Britain. On the other hand, he had reserved the
express right to conquer any of her islands south of Bermuda.
The West Indies were then the richest commercial region on
the globe in the value of their products; and France wished
not only to increase her already large possessions there, but
also to establish more solidly her political and military tenure.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/99.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/99.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Leeward Islands (West Indies) Station</div>

<p>In September, 1778, the British Island of Dominica was
seized by an expedition from the adjacent French colony of
Martinique. The affair was a surprise, and possesses no
special military interest; but it is instructive to observe that
Great Britain was unprepared, in the West Indies as elsewhere,
when the war began. A change had been made
shortly before in the command of the Leeward Islands Station,
as it was called, which extended from Antigua southward
over the Lesser Antilles with headquarters at Barbados.
Rear-Admiral the Hon. Samuel Barrington, the new-comer,
leaving home before war had been declared, had orders not
to quit Barbados till further instructions should arrive.
These had not reached him when he learned of the loss of
Dominica. The French had received their orders on the
17th of August. The blow was intrinsically somewhat serious,
so far as the mere capture of a position can be, because
the fortifications were strong, though they had been inadequately
garrisoned. It is a mistake to build works and not
man them, for their fall transfers to the enemy strength
which he otherwise would need time to create. To the
French the conquest was useful beyond its commercial value,
because it closed a gap in their possessions. They now held
four consecutive islands, from north to south, Guadeloupe,
Dominica, Martinique, and Santa Lucia.</p>

<p>Barrington had two ships of the line: his flagship, the
<i>Prince of Wales</i>, 74, and the <i>Boyne</i>, 70. If he had been
cruising, these would probably have deterred the French.
Upon receiving the news he put to sea, going as far as Antigua;
but he did not venture to stay away because his expected
instructions had not come yet, and, like Keppel, he feared an
ungenerous construction of his actions. He therefore remained
in Barbados, patiently watching for an opportunity to act.</p>

<p>The departure of Howe and the approach of winter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
determined the transference of British troops and ships from
the continent to the Leeward Islands. Reinforcements had
given the British fleet in America a numerical superiority,
which for the time imposed a check upon d'Estaing; but
Byron, proverbially unlucky in weather, was driven crippled
to Newport, leaving the French free to quit Boston. The
difficulty of provisioning so large a force as twelve ships of
the line at first threatened to prevent the withdrawal, supplies
being then extremely scarce in the port; but at the
critical moment American privateers brought in large numbers
of prizes, laden with provisions from Europe for the
British army. Thus d'Estaing was enabled to sail for Martinique
on the 4th of November. On the same day there
left New York for Barbados a British squadron,&mdash;two 64's,
three 50's, and three smaller craft,&mdash;under the command
of Commodore William Hotham, convoying five thousand
troops for service in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Being bound for nearly the same point, the two hostile
bodies steered parallel courses, each ignorant of the other's
nearness. In the latitude of Bermuda both suffered from a
violent gale, but the French most; the flagship <i>Languedoc</i>
losing her main and mizzen topmasts. On the 25th of November
one<a id="footnotetag54" name="footnotetag54"></a><a href="#footnote54"><sup>54</sup></a> of Hotham's convoy fell into the hands of d'Estaing,
who then first learned of the British sailing. Doubtful
whether their destination was Barbados or Antigua,&mdash;their
two chief stations,&mdash;he decided for the latter. Arriving
off it on the 6th of December, he cruised for forty-eight
hours, and then bore away for Fort Royal, Martinique, the
principal French depot in the West Indies, where he anchored
on the 9th. On the 10th Hotham joined Barrington at Barbados.</p>

<p>Barrington knew already what he wanted to do, and
therefore lost not a moment in deliberation. The troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>
were kept on board, Hotham's convoy arrangements being
left as they were. On the morning of December 12th the
entire force sailed again, the main changes in it being in the
chief command, and in the addition of Barrington's two ships
of the line. On the afternoon of the 13th the shipping
anchored in the Grand Cul de Sac, an inlet on the west side
of Santa Lucia, which is seventy miles east-north-east from
Barbados. Part of the troops landed at once, and seized
the batteries and heights on the north side of the bay. The
remainder were put on shore the next morning. The French
forces were inadequate to defend their works; but it is to
be observed that they were driven with unremitting energy,
and that to this promptness the British owed their ability to hold the position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/101.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/101.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Island of Santa Lucia</div>

<p>Three miles north of the Cul de Sac is a bay then called
the Car&#233;nage; now Port Castries. At its northern extremity
is a precipitous promontory, La Vigie, then fortified,
upon the tenure of which depended not only control of that
anchorage, but also access to the rear of the works which
commanded the Cul de Sac. If those works fell, the British
squadron must abandon its position and put to sea, where
d'Estaing's much superior fleet would be in waiting. On
the other hand, if the squadron were crushed at its anchors,
the troops were isolated and must ultimately capitulate.
Therefore La Vigie and the squadron were the two keys to
the situation, and the loss of either would be decisive.</p>

<p>By the evening of the 14th the British held the shore line
from La Vigie to the southern point of the Cul de Sac, as
well as Morne Fortun&#233; (Fort Charlotte), the capital of the
island. The feeble French garrison retired to the interior,
leaving its guns unspiked, and its ammunition and stores
untouched,&mdash;another instance of the danger of works turning
to one's own disadvantage. It was Barrington's purpose
now to remove the transports to the Car&#233;nage, as a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
commodious harbour, probably also better defended; but he was
prevented by the arrival of d'Estaing that afternoon. "Just
as all the important stations were secured, the French colours
struck, and General Grant's headquarters established at
the Governor's house, the <i>Ariadne</i> frigate came in sight with
the signal abroad for the approach of an enemy."<a id="footnotetag55" name="footnotetag55"></a><a href="#footnote55"><sup>55</sup></a> The
French fleet was seen soon afterwards from the heights above the squadron.</p>

<p>The British had gained much so far by celerity, but they
still spared no time to take breath. The night was passed
by the soldiers in strengthening their positions, and by the
Rear-Admiral in rectifying his order to meet the expected
attack. The transports, between fifty and sixty in number,
were moved inside the ships of war, and the latter were most
carefully disposed across the mouth of the Cul de Sac bay.
At the northern (windward)<a id="footnotetag56" name="footnotetag56"></a><a href="#footnote56"><sup>56</sup></a> end was placed the <i>Isis</i>, 50,
well under the point to prevent anything from passing round
her; but for further security she was supported by three
frigates, anchored abreast of the interval between her and
the shore. From the <i>Isis</i> the line extended to the southward,
inclining slightly outward; the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, 74,
Barrington's flagship, taking the southern flank, as the most
exposed position. Between her and the <i>Isis</i> were five other
ships,&mdash;the <i>Boyne</i>, 70, <i>Nonsuch</i>, 64, <i>St. Albans</i>, 64,
<i>Preston</i>,
50, and <i>Centurion</i>, 50. The works left by the French at the
north and south points of the bay may have been used to
support the flanks, but Barrington does not say so in his report.</p>

<p>D'Estaing had twelve ships of the line, and two days after
this was able to land seven thousand troops. With such a
superiority it is evident that the British would have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
stopped in the midst of their operations, if he had arrived
twenty-four hours sooner. To gain time, Barrington had
sought to prevent intelligence reaching Fort Royal, less
than fifty miles distant, by sending cruisers in advance of his
squadron, to cover the approaches to Santa Lucia; but, despite
his care, d'Estaing had the news on the 14th. He
sailed at once, and, as has been said, was off Santa Lucia
that evening. At daybreak of the 15th he stood in for the
Car&#233;nage; but when he came within range, a lively cannonade
told him that the enemy was already in possession.
He decided therefore to attack the squadron in the Cul de
Sac, and at 11.30 the French passed along it from north to
south, firing, but without effect. A second attempt was
made in the afternoon, directed upon the lee flank, but it
was equally unavailing. The British had three men killed;
the French loss is not given, but is said to have been slight.
It is stated that that day the sea breeze did not penetrate
far enough into the bay to admit closing. This frequently
happens, but it does not alter the fact that the squadron
was the proper point of attack, and that, especially in the
winter season, an opportunity to close must offer soon.
D'Estaing, governed probably by the soldierly bias he more
than once betrayed, decided now to assault the works on
shore. Anchoring in a small bay north of the Car&#233;nage, he
landed seven thousand men, and on the 18th attempted to
storm the British lines at La Vigie. The neck of land connecting
the promontory with the island is very flat, and
the French therefore labored under great disadvantage
through the commanding position of their enemy. It was
a repetition of Bunker Hill, and of many other ill-judged
and precipitate frontal attacks. After three gallant but ineffectual
charges, led by d'Estaing in person, the assailants
retired, with the loss of forty-one officers and eight
hundred rank and file, killed and wounded.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/104.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/104.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Admiral, the Honourable Samuel Barrington</div>

<p>D'Estaing re&#235;mbarked his men, and stood ready again
to attack Barrington; a frigate being stationed off the Cul
de Sac, to give notice when the wind should serve. On the
24th she signalled, and the fleet weighed; but Barrington,
who had taken a very great risk for an adequate object,
took no unnecessary chances through presumption. He had
employed his respite to warp the ships of war farther in, where
the breeze reached less certainly, and where narrower waters
gave better support to the flanks. He had strengthened the
latter also by new works, in which he had placed heavy guns
from the ships, manned by seamen. For these or other
reasons d'Estaing did not attack. On the 29th he quitted
the island, and on the 30th the French governor, the Chevalier
de Micoud, formally capitulated.</p>

<p>This achievement of Barrington and of Major-General
James Grant, who was associated with him, was greeted
at the time with an applause which will be echoed by the
military judgment of a later age. There is a particular
pleasure in finding the willingness to incur a great risk, conjoined
with a care that chances nothing against which the
utmost diligence and skill can provide. The celerity,
forethought, wariness, and daring of Admiral Barrington
have inscribed upon the records of the British Navy a
success the distinction of which should be measured, not
by the largeness of the scale, but by the perfection of the
workmanship, and by the energy of the execution in face of great odds.</p>

<p>Santa Lucia remained in the hands of the British throughout
the war. It was an important acquisition, because at
its north-west extremity was a good and defensible anchorage,
Gros Ilet Bay, only thirty miles from Fort Royal in
Martinique. In it the British fleet could lie, when desirable
to close-watch the enemy, yet not be worried for the safety
of the port when away; for it was but an outpost, not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>
base of operations, as Fort Royal was. It was thus used
continually, and from it Rodney issued for his great victory in April, 1782.</p>

<p>During the first six months of 1779 no important incident
occurred in the West Indies. On the 6th of January, Vice-Admiral
Byron, with ten ships of the line from Narragansett
Bay, reached Santa Lucia, and relieved Barrington of the chief
command. Both the British and the French fleets were
reinforced in the course of the spring, but the relative strength
remained nearly as before, until the 27th of June, when the
arrival of a division from Brest made the French numbers somewhat superior.</p>

<p>Shortly before this, Byron had been constrained by one of
the commercial exigencies which constantly embarrassed the
military action of British admirals. A large convoy of trading
ships, bound to England, was collecting at St. Kitts, and
he thought necessary to accompany it part of the homeward
way, until well clear of the French West India cruisers.
For this purpose he left Santa Lucia early in June. As soon
as the coast was clear, d'Estaing, informed of Byron's object,
sent a small combined expedition against St. Vincent, which
was surrendered on the 18th of the month. On the 30th
the French admiral himself quitted Fort Royal with his
whole fleet,&mdash;twenty-five ships of the line and several
frigates,&mdash;directing his course for the British Island of
Grenada, before which he anchored on the 2d of July.
With commendable promptitude, he landed his troops that
evening, and on the 4th the island capitulated. Except as
represented by one small armed sloop, which was taken, the
British Navy had no part in this transaction. Thirty richly
laden merchant ships were captured in the port.</p>

<p>At daybreak of July 6th, Byron appeared with twenty-one
sail of the line, one frigate, and a convoy of twenty-eight
vessels, carrying troops and equipments. He had returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
to Santa Lucia on the 1st, and there had heard of the loss
of St. Vincent, with a rumor that the French had gone
against Grenada. He consequently had put to sea on the
3d, with the force mentioned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/106.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/106.jpg" alt="" /></a>
D'Estaing and Byron, July 6, 1779</div>

<p>The British approach was reported to d'Estaing during
the night of July 5th. Most of his fleet was then lying at
anchor off Georgetown, at the south-west of the island;
some vessels, which had been under way on look-out duty,
had fallen to leeward.<a id="footnotetag57" name="footnotetag57"></a><a href="#footnote57"><sup>57</sup></a> At 4 A.M. the French began to lift
their anchors, with orders to form line of battle on the starboard
tack, in order of speed; that is, as rapidly as possible
without regard to usual stations. When daylight had fully
made, the British fleet (A) was seen standing down from the
northward, close inshore, on the port tack, with the wind
free at north-east by east. It was not in order, as is evident
from the fact that the ships nearest the enemy, and therefore
first to close, ought to have been in the rear on the then tack.
For this condition there is no evident excuse; for a fleet
having a convoy necessarily proceeds so slowly that the war-ships
can keep reasonable order for mutual support. Moreover,
irregularities that are permissible in case of emergency,
or when no enemy can be encountered suddenly, cease to be
so when the imminent probability of a meeting exists. The
worst results of the day are to be attributed to this fault.
Being short of frigates, Byron had assigned three ships of
the line (a), under Rear-Admiral Rowley, to the convoy,
which of course was on the off hand from the enemy, and
somewhat in the rear. It was understood, however, that
these would be called into the line, if needed.</p>

<p>When the French (AA) were first perceived by Byron,
their line was forming; the long thin column lengthening
out gradually to the north-north-west, from the confused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>
cluster<a id="footnotetag58" name="footnotetag58"></a><a href="#footnote58"><sup>58</sup></a> still to be seen at the anchorage. Hoping to profit
by their disorder, he signalled "a general chase in that
quarter,<a id="footnotetag59" name="footnotetag59"></a><a href="#footnote59"><sup>59</sup></a> as well as for Rear-Admiral Rowley to leave the
convoy; and as not more than fourteen or fifteen of the
enemy's ships appeared to be in line, the signal was made
for the ships to engage, <i>and form as they could get up</i>."<a id="footnotetag60" name="footnotetag60"></a><a href="#footnote60"><sup>60</sup></a>
It is clear from this not only that the ships were not in order,
but also that they were to form under fire. Three ships,
the <i>Sultan</i>, 74, the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, 74, and the <i>Boyne</i>, 70,
in the order named,&mdash;the second carrying Barrington's
flag,&mdash;were well ahead of the fleet (b). The direction prescribed
for the attack, that of the clustered ships in the
French rear, carried the British down on a south-south-west,
or south by west, course; and as the enemy's van and centre
were drawing out to the north-north-west, the two lines at
that time resembled the legs of a "V," the point of which
was the anchorage off Georgetown. Barrington's three ships
therefore neared the French order gradually, and had to
receive its fire for some time before they could reply, unless,
by hauling to the wind, they diverged from the set course.
This, and their isolation, made their loss very heavy. When
they reached the rear of the French, the latter's column was
tolerably formed, and Barrington's ships wore (w) in succession,&mdash;just
as Harland's had done in Keppel's action,&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
follow on the other tack. In doing this, the <i>Sultan</i> kept away
under the stern of the enemy's rearmost ship, to rake her;
to avoid which the latter bore up. The <i>Sultan</i> thus lost
time and ground, and Barrington took the lead, standing
along the French line, from rear to van, and to windward.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the forming of the enemy had revealed to
Byron for the first time, and to his dismay, that he had been
deceived in thinking the French force inferior to his own.
"However, the general chase was continued, and the signal
made for close engagement."<a id="footnotetag61" name="footnotetag61"></a><a href="#footnote61"><sup>61</sup></a> The remainder of the ships
stood down on the port tack, as the first three had done, and
wore in the wake of the latter, whom they followed; but
before reaching the point of wearing, three ships, "the <i>Grafton</i>,
74, the <i>Cornwall</i>, 74, and the <i>Lion</i>, 64 (c), <i>happening
to be to leeward</i>,<a id="footnotetag62" name="footnotetag62"></a><a href="#footnote62"><sup>62</sup></a> sustained the fire of the enemy's whole line,
as it passed on the starboard tack." It seems clear that,
having had the wind, during the night and now, and being
in search of an enemy, it should not have "happened" that
any ships should have been so far to leeward as to be unsupported.
Captain Thomas White, R.N., writing as an advocate
of Byron, says,<a id="footnotetag63" name="footnotetag63"></a><a href="#footnote63"><sup>63</sup></a> "while the van was wearing ... the
sternmost ships were coming up under Rear-Admiral Hyde
Parker.... Among these ships, the <i>Cornwall</i> and <i>Lion</i>,
from being nearer the enemy than those about them (for the
rear division had not then <i>formed into line</i>), drew upon themselves
almost the whole of the enemy's fire." No words can
show more clearly the disastrous, precipitate disorder in
which this attack was conducted. The <i>Grafton</i>, White says,
was similarly situated. In consequence, these three were so
crippled, besides a heavy loss in men, that they dropped far
to leeward and astern (c', c"), when on the other tack.</p>

<p>When the British ships in general had got round, and were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>
in line ahead on the starboard tack,&mdash;the same as the French,&mdash;ranging
from rear to van of the enemy (Positions B, B, B),
Byron signalled for the eight leading ships to close together,
for mutual support, and to engage close. This, which should
have been done&mdash;not with finikin precision, but with military
adequacy&mdash;before engaging, was less easy now, in
the din of battle and with crippled ships. A quick-eyed
subordinate, however, did something to remedy the error
of his chief. Rear-Admiral Rowley was still considerably
astern, having to make up the distance between the convoy
and the fleet. As he followed the latter, he saw Barrington's
three ships unduly separated and doubtless visibly much
mauled. Instead, therefore, of blindly following his leader,
he cut straight across (aa) to the head of the column to
support the van,&mdash;an act almost absolutely identical with
that which won Nelson renown at Cape St. Vincent. In
this he was followed by the <i>Monmouth</i>, 64, the brilliancy of
whose bearing was so conspicuous to the two fleets that it is
said the French officers after the battle toasted "the little
black ship." She and the <i>Suffolk</i>, 74, Rowley's flagship, also
suffered severely in this gallant feat.</p>

<p>It was imperative with Byron now to keep his van well up
with the enemy, lest he should uncover the convoy, broad
on the weather bow of the two fleets. "They seemed much
inclined to cut off the convoy, and had it much in their power
by means of their large frigates, independent of ships of
the line."<a id="footnotetag64" name="footnotetag64"></a><a href="#footnote64"><sup>64</sup></a> On the other hand, the <i>Cornwall, Grafton</i>, and
<i>Lion</i>, though they got their heads round, could not keep up
with the fleet (c', c"), and were dropping also to leeward&mdash;towards
the enemy. At noon, or soon after, d'Estaing
bore up with the body of his force to join some of his vessels
that had fallen to leeward. Byron very properly&mdash;under
his conditions of inferiority&mdash;kept his wind; and the separation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>
of the two fleets, thus produced, caused firing to cease at 1 P.M.</p>

<p>The enemies were now ranged on parallel lines, some distance
apart; still on the starboard tack, heading north-north
west. Between the two, but far astern, the <i>Cornwall, Grafton,
Lion</i>, and a fourth British ship, the <i>Fame</i>, were toiling along,
greatly crippled. At 3 P.M., the French, now in good order,
tacked together (t, t, t), which caused them to head towards
these disabled vessels. Byron at once imitated the movement,
and the eyes of all in the two fleets anxiously watched
the result. Captain Cornwallis of the <i>Lion</i>, measuring the
situation accurately, saw that, if he continued ahead, he
would be in the midst of the French by the time he got
abreast of them. Having only his foremast standing, he
put his helm up, and stood broad off before the wind (c"),
across the enemy's bows, for Jamaica. He was not pursued.
The other three, unable to tack and afraid to wear, which
would put them also in the enemy's power, stood on, passed
to windward of the latter, receiving several broadsides, and
so escaped to the northward. The <i>Monmouth</i> was equally
maltreated; in fact, she had not been able to tack to the
southward with the fleet. Continuing north (a'), she became
now much separated. D'Estaing afterwards reestablished
his order of battle on the port tack, forming upon the
then leewardmost ship, on the line BC.</p>

<p>Byron's action off Grenada, viewed as an isolated event,
was the most disastrous in results that the British Navy had
fought since Beachy Head, in 1690. That the <i>Cornwall,
Grafton</i>, and <i>Lion</i> were not captured was due simply to the
strained and inept caution of the French admiral. This Byron
virtually admitted. "To my great surprise no ship of the
enemy was detached after the <i>Lion</i>. The <i>Grafton</i> and <i>Cornwall</i>
might have been weathered by the French, if they had
kept their wind,... but they persevered so strictly in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>
declining every chance of close action that they contented
themselves with firing upon these ships when passing barely
within gunshot, and suffered them to rejoin the squadron,
without one effort to cut them off." Suffren,<a id="footnotetag65" name="footnotetag65"></a><a href="#footnote65"><sup>65</sup></a> who led the
French on the starboard tack, and whose ship, the <i>Fantasque</i>,
64, lost 22 killed and 43 wounded, wrote: "Had our admiral's
seamanship equalled his courage, we would not have allowed
four dismasted ships to escape." That the <i>Monmouth</i> and
<i>Fame</i> could also have been secured is extremely probable;
and if Byron, in order to save them, had borne down to renew
the action, the disaster might have become a catastrophe.</p>

<p>That nothing resulted to the French from their great advantage
is therefore to be ascribed to the incapacity of their
Commander-in-Chief. It is instructive to note also the
causes of the grave calamity which befell the British, when
twenty-one ships met twenty-four,<a id="footnotetag66" name="footnotetag66"></a><a href="#footnote66"><sup>66</sup></a>&mdash;a sensible but not
overwhelming superiority. These facts have been shown
sufficiently. Byron's disaster was due to attacking with
needless precipitation, and in needless disorder. He had the
weather-gage, it was early morning, and the northeast trade-wind,
already a working breeze, must freshen as the day advanced.
The French were tied to their new conquest, which
they could not abandon without humiliation; not to speak
of their troops ashore. Even had they wished to retreat,
they could not have done so before a general chase, unless
prepared to sacrifice their slower ships. If twenty-four ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>
could reconcile themselves to running from twenty-one, it was
scarcely possible but that the fastest of these would overtake
the slowest of those. There was time for fighting, an opportunity
for forcing action which could not be evaded, and
time also for the British to form in reasonably good order.</p>

<p>It is important to consider this, because, while Keppel must
be approved for attacking in partial disorder, Byron must be
blamed for attacking in utter disorder. Keppel had to snatch
opportunity from an unwilling foe. Having himself the lee-gage,
he could not pick and choose, nor yet man&oelig;uvre; yet
he brought his fleet into action, giving mutual support
throughout nearly, if not quite, the whole line. What Byron
did has been set forth; the sting is that his bungling tactics
can find no extenuation in any urgency of the case.</p>

<p>The loss of the two fleets, as given by the authorities of
either nation, were: British, 183 killed, 346 wounded; French,
190 killed, 759 wounded. Of the British total, 126 killed
and 235 wounded, or two thirds, fell to the two groups of
three ships each, which by Byron's mismanagement were
successively exposed to be cut up in detail by the concentrated
fire of the enemy. The British loss in spars and sails&mdash;in
motive-power&mdash;also exceeded greatly that of the French.</p>

<p>After the action d'Estaing returned quietly to Grenada.
Byron went to St. Kitts to refit; but repairs were most difficult,
owing to the dearth of stores in which the Admiralty
had left the West Indies. With all the skill of the seamen
of that day in making good damages, the ships remained
long unserviceable, causing great apprehension for the other
islands. This state of things d'Estaing left unimproved, as
he had his advantage in the battle. He did, indeed, parade
his superior force before Byron's fleet as it lay at anchor;
but, beyond the humiliation naturally felt by a Navy which
prided itself on ruling the sea, no further injury was done.</p>

<p>In August Byron sailed for England. Barrington had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
already gone home, wounded. The station therefore was
left in command of Rear-Admiral Hyde Parker,<a id="footnotetag67" name="footnotetag67"></a><a href="#footnote67"><sup>67</sup></a> and so remained
until March, 1780, when the celebrated Rodney
arrived as Commander-in-Chief on the Leeward Islands
Station. The North American Station was given to Vice-Admiral
Marriot Arbuthnot, who had under him a half-dozen
ships of the line, with headquarters at New York.
His command was ordinarily independent of Rodney's, but
the latter had no hesitation in going to New York on emergency
and taking charge there; in doing which he had the approval of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>The approach of winter in 1778 had determined the cessation
of operations, both naval and military, in the northern
part of the American continent, and had led to the transfer
of five thousand troops to the West Indies, already noted.
At the same time, an unjustifiable extension of British effort,
having regard to the disposable means, was undertaken in
the southern States of Georgia and South Carolina. On
the 27th of November a small detachment of troops under
Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell, sailed from Sandy
Hook, convoyed by a division of frigates commanded by
Captain Hyde Parker.<a id="footnotetag68" name="footnotetag68"></a><a href="#footnote68"><sup>68</sup></a> The expedition entered the Savannah
River four weeks later, and soon afterwards occupied the
city of the same name. Simultaneously with this, by Clinton's
orders, General Prevost moved from Florida, then a
British colony, with all the men he could spare from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span>
defence of St. Augustine. Upon his arrival in Savannah he
took command of the whole force thus assembled.</p>

<p>These operations, which during 1779 extended as far as
the neighbourhood of Charleston, depended upon the control
of the water, and are a conspicuous example of misapplication
of power to the point of ultimate self-destruction.
They were in 1778-79 essentially of a minor character, especially
the maritime part, and will therefore be dismissed
with the remark that the Navy, by small vessels, accompanied
every movement in a country cut up in all directions by watercourses,
big and little. "The defence of this province,"
wrote Parker, "must greatly depend on the naval force upon
the different inland creeks. I am therefore forming some
galleys covered from musketry, which I believe will have a
good effect." These were precursors of the "tin-clads" of
the American War of Secession, a century later. Not even
an armored ship is a new thing under the sun.</p>

<p>In the southern States, from Georgia to Virginia, the part
of the Navy from first to last was subsidiary, though important.
It is therefore unnecessary to go into details, but
most necessary to note that here, by misdirection of effort
and abuse of means, was initiated the fatal movement which
henceforth divided the small British army in North America
into two sections, wholly out of mutual support. Here Sir
William Howe's error of 1777 was reproduced on a larger scale
and was therefore more fatal. This led directly, by the inevitable
logic of a false position, to Cornwallis's march
through North Carolina into Virginia, to Yorktown in 1781,
and to the signal demonstration of sea power off Chesapeake
Bay, which at a blow accomplished the independence of
the United States. No hostile strategist could have severed
the British army more hopelessly than did the British government;
no fate could have been more inexorable than was its
own perverse will. The personal alienation and official
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>
quarrel between Sir Henry Clinton and Lord Cornwallis,
their divided counsels and divergent action, were but the
natural result, and the reflection, of a situation essentially
self-contradictory and exasperating.</p>

<p>As the hurricane season of 1779 advanced, d'Estaing, who
had orders to bring back to France the ships of the line with
which he had sailed from Toulon in 1778, resolved to go first
upon the American coast, off South Carolina or Georgia.
Arriving with his whole fleet at the mouth of the Savannah,
August 31st, he decided to attempt to wrest the city of
Savannah from the British. This would have been of real
service to the latter, had it nipped in the bud their ex-centric
undertaking; but, after three weeks of opening trenches, an
assault upon the place failed. D'Estaing then sailed for
Europe with the ships designated to accompany him, the others
returning to the West Indies in two squadrons, under de
Grasse and La Motte-Picquet. Though fruitless in its main
object, this enterprise of d'Estaing had the important indirect
effect of causing the British to abandon Narragansett
Bay. Upon the news of his appearance, Sir Henry Clinton
had felt that, with his greatly diminished army, he could not
hold both Rhode Island and New York. He therefore
ordered the evacuation of the former, thus surrendering, to
use again Rodney's words, "the best and noblest harbour in
America." The following summer it was occupied in force by the French.</p>

<p>D'Estaing was succeeded in the chief command, in the
West Indies and North America, by Rear-Admiral de Guichen,<a id="footnotetag69" name="footnotetag69"></a><a href="#footnote69"><sup>69</sup></a>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE NAVAL WAR IN EUROPEAN WATERS, 1779.
ALLIED FLEETS INVADE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL. RODNEY DESTROYS TWO SPANISH
SQUADRONS AND RELIEVES GIBRALTAR</h3>


<p>In June, 1779, the maritime situation of Great Britain
had become much more serious by Spain's declaring
war. At the same moment that d'Estaing with
twenty-five ships of the line had confronted Byron's
twenty-one, the Channel fleet of forty sail had seen gathering
against it a host of sixty-six. Of this great number thirty-six were Spanish.</p>

<p>The open declaration of Spain had been preceded by a
secret alliance with France, signed on the 12th of April.
Fearing that the British government would take betimes the
reasonable and proper step of blockading the Brest fleet of
thirty with the Channel forty, thus assuming a central position
with reference to its enemies and anticipating the policy
of Lord St. Vincent, the French Ministry hurried its ships
to sea on the 4th of June; Admiral d'Orvilliers, Keppel's
opponent, still in command. His orders were to cruise near
the island of Cizarga, off the north-west coast of Spain,
where the Spaniards were to join him. On the 11th of June
he was at the rendezvous, but not till the 23d of July did
the bulk of the Spanish force appear. During this time, the
French, insufficiently equipped from the first, owing to the
haste of their departure, were consuming provisions and
water, not to speak of wasting pleasant summer weather.
Their ships also were ravaged by an epidemic fever. Upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span>
the junction, d'Orvilliers found that the Spaniards had not
been furnished with the French system of signals, although
by the treaty the French admiral was to be in chief command.
The rectification of this oversight caused further delay, but
on the 11th of August the combined fleet sighted Ushant,
and on the 14th was off the Lizard. On the 16th it appeared
before Plymouth, and there on the 17th captured the British
64-gun ship <i>Ardent</i>.</p>

<p>Thirty-five ships of the Channel fleet had gone to sea on
the 16th of June, and now were cruising outside, under the
command of Admiral Sir Charles Hardy. His station was
from ten to twenty leagues south-west of Scilly; consequently
he had not been seen by the enemy, who from Ushant had
stood up the Channel. The allies, now nearly double the
numbers of the British, were between them and their ports,&mdash;a
serious situation doubtless, but by no means desperate;
not so dangerous for sailing ships as it probably will be for
steamers to have an enemy between them and their coal.</p>

<p>The alarm in England was very great, especially in the
south. On the 9th of July a royal proclamation had commanded
all horses and cattle to be driven from the coasts, in
case of invasion. Booms had been placed across the entrance
to Plymouth Harbor, and orders were sent from the
Admiralty to sink vessels across the harbour's mouth. Many
who had the means withdrew into the interior, which increased
the panic. Great merchant fleets were then on the
sea, homeward bound. If d'Orvilliers were gone to cruise
in the approaches to the Channel, instead of to the Spanish
coast, these might be taken; and for some time his whereabouts
were unknown. As it was, the Jamaica convoy, over
two hundred sail, got in a few days before the allies appeared,
and the Leeward Islands fleet had similar good fortune.
Eight homeward bound East Indiamen were less lucky, but,
being warned of their danger, took refuge in the Shannon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>
and there remained till the trouble blew over. On the other
hand, the stock market stood firm. Nevertheless, it was
justly felt that such a state of things as a vastly superior
hostile fleet in the Channel should not have been. Sir John
Jervis, afterward Earl St. Vincent, who commanded a ship
in the fleet, wrote to his sister: "What a humiliating state
is our country reduced to!" but he added that he laughed at
the idea of invasion.</p>

<p>The French had placed a force of fifty thousand men at
Le Havre and St. Malo, and collected four hundred vessels
for their transport. Their plans were not certainly known,
but enough had transpired to cause reasonable anxiety;
and the crisis, on its face, was very serious. Not their own
preparations, but the inefficiency of their enemies, in counsel
and in preparation, saved the British Islands from invasion.
What the results of this would have been is another question,&mdash;a
question of land warfare. The original scheme of the
French Ministry was to seize the Isle of Wight, securing
Spithead as an anchorage for the fleet, and to prosecute their
enterprise from this near and reasonably secure base. Referring
to this first project, d'Orvilliers wrote: "We will
seek the enemy at St. Helen's,<a id="footnotetag70" name="footnotetag70"></a><a href="#footnote70"><sup>70</sup></a> and then, if I find that roadstead
unoccupied, or make myself master of it, I will send
word to Marshal De Vaux, at Le Havre, and inform him of
the measures I will take to insure his passage, which [measures]
will depend upon the position of the English main
fleet [d&#232;pendront des forces sup&#232;rieures des Anglais]. That
is to say, I myself will lead the combined fleet on that side
[against their main body], to contain the enemy, and I will
send, on the other side [to convoy], a light squadron, with a
sufficient number of ships of the line and frigates; or I will
propose to M. de Cordova to take this latter station, in order
that the passage of the army may be free and sure. I assume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span>
that then, either by the engagement I shall have fought
with the enemy, <i>or by their retreat into their ports</i>, I shall be
certain of their situation and of the success of the operation."<a id="footnotetag71" name="footnotetag71"></a><a href="#footnote71"><sup>71</sup></a>
It will be observed that d'Orvilliers, accounted then and now
one of the best officers of his day in the French navy, takes
here into full account the British "fleet in being." The
main body of the allies, fifty ships, was to hold this in check,
while a smaller force&mdash;Cordova had command of a special
"squadron of observation," of sixteen ships of the line&mdash;was
to convoy the crossing.</p>

<p>These projects all fell to pieces before a strong east wind,
and a change of mind in the French government. On the
16th of August, before Plymouth, d'Orvilliers was notified
that not the Isle of Wight, but the coast of Cornwall, near
Falmouth, was to be the scene of landing. The effect of
this was to deprive the huge fleet of any anchorage,&mdash;a
resource necessary even to steamers, and far more to sailing
vessels aiming to remain in a position. As a point to begin
shore operations, too, as well as to sustain them, such a
remote corner of the country to be invaded was absurd.
D'Orvilliers duly represented all this, but could not stay
where he was long enough to get a reply. An easterly gale
came on, which blew hard for several days and drove the
allies out of the Channel. On the 25th of August word was
received that the British fleet was near Scilly. A council
of war was then held, which decided that, in view of the
terrible increase of disease in the shipping, and of the shortness
of provisions, it was expedient not to re&#235;nter the Channel,
but to seek the enemy, and bring him to battle. This
was done. On the 29th Hardy was sighted, being then on
his return up Channel. With the disparity of force he could
not but decline action, and the allies were unable to compel it.
On the 3d of September he reached Spithead. D'Orvilliers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>
soon afterwards received orders to return to Brest, and on
the 14th the combined fleet anchored there.</p>

<p>The criticism to be passed on the conduct of this summer
campaign by the British Ministry is twofold. In the first
place, it was not ready according to the reasonable standard
of the day, which recognised in the probable co&#245;peration
of the two Bourbon kingdoms, France and Spain, the measure
of the minimum naval force permissible to Great Britain.
Secondly, the entrance of Spain into the war had been foreseen
months before. For the inferior force, therefore, it
was essential to prevent a junction,&mdash;to take an interior
position. The Channel fleet ought to have been off Brest
before the French sailed. After they were gone, there was
still fair ground for the contention of the Opposition, that
they should have been followed, and attacked, off the coast
of Spain. During the six weeks they waited there, they were
inferior to Hardy's force. Allowance here must be made,
however, for the inability of a representative government
to disregard popular outcry, and to uncover the main approach
to its own ports. This, indeed, does but magnify
the error made in not watching Brest betimes; for in
such case a fleet before Brest covered also the Channel.</p>

<p>With regard to the objects of the war in which they had
become partners, the views of France and Spain accorded in
but one point,&mdash;the desirability of injuring Great Britain.
Each had its own special aim for its own advantage. This
necessarily introduced divergence of effort; but, France
having first embarked alone in the contest and then sought
the aid of Spain, the particular objects of her ally naturally
obtained from the beginning a certain precedence. Until
near the close of the war, it may be said that the chief ambitions
of France were in the West Indies; those of Spain,
in Europe,&mdash;to regain Minorca and Gibraltar.</p>

<p>In this way Gibraltar became a leading factor in the contest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>
and affected, directly or indirectly, the major operations
throughout the world, by the amount of force absorbed
in attacking and preserving it. After the futile effort in the
Channel, in 1779, Spain recalled her vessels from Brest.
"The project of a descent upon England was abandoned
provisionally. To blockade Gibraltar, to have in America
and Asia force sufficient to hold the British in check, and to
take the offensive in the West Indies,&mdash;such," wrote the
French government to its ambassador in Madrid, "was
the plan of campaign adopted for 1780." Immediately upon
the declaration of war, intercourse between Gibraltar and the
Spanish mainland was stopped. Soon afterwards a blockade
by sea was instituted; fifteen cruisers being stationed at
the entrance of the Bay, where they seized and sent into
Spanish ports all vessels, neutral or British, bound to the
Rock. This blockade was effectively supported from Cadiz,
but a Spanish force of some ships of the line and many small
vessels also maintained it more directly from Algeciras, on
the Spanish side of the Bay of Gibraltar. The British Mediterranean
squadron, then consisting only of one 60-gun ship,
three frigates, and a sloop, was wholly unable to afford relief.
At the close of the year 1779, flour in Gibraltar was
fourteen guineas the barrel, and other provisions in proportion.
It became therefore imminently necessary to throw in
supplies of all kinds, as well as to reinforce the garrison.
To this service Rodney was assigned; and with it he began
the brilliant career, the chief scene of which was to be in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Rodney was appointed to command the Leeward Islands
Station on the 1st of October, 1779. He was to be accompanied
there immediately by only four or five ships of the
line; but advantage was taken of his sailing, to place under
the charge of an officer of his approved reputation a great
force, composed of his small division and a large fraction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>
the Channel fleet, to convey supplies and reinforcements to
Gibraltar and Minorca. On the 29th of December the whole
body, after many delays in getting down Channel, put to
sea from Plymouth: twenty-two ships of the line, fourteen
frigates and smaller vessels, besides a huge collection of
storeships, victuallers, ordnance vessels, troop-ships, and
merchantmen,&mdash;the last named being the "trade" for the West Indies and Portugal.</p>

<p>On the 7th of January, 1780, a hundred leagues west of
Cape Finisterre, the West India ships parted for their destination,
under convoy of a ship of the line and three frigates.
At daylight on the 8th, twenty-two sail were seen to the
north-east, the squadron apparently having passed them in
the night. Chase was at once given, and the whole were
taken in a few hours. Seven were ships of war, one
64 and six frigates; the remainder merchant vessels,
laden with naval stores and provisions for the Spanish fleet
at Cadiz. The provision ships, twelve in number, were
diverted at once to the relief of Gibraltar, under charge of
the Spanish sixty-four, which had been one of their convoy
before capture, and was now manned by a British crew. Continuing
on, intelligence was received from time to time by
passing vessels that a Spanish squadron was cruising off
Cape St. Vincent. Thus forewarned, orders were given to
all captains to be prepared for battle as the Cape was neared.
On the 16th it was passed, and at 1 P.M. sails in the south-east
were signalled. These were a Spanish squadron of eleven
ships of the line, and two 26-gun frigates. Rodney at once
bore down for them under a press of canvas, making signal for
the line abreast.<a id="footnotetag72" name="footnotetag72"></a><a href="#footnote72"><sup>72</sup></a> Seeing, however, that the enemy was
trying to form line of battle ahead on the starboard tack,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span>
which with a westerly wind was with heads to the southward,
towards Cadiz, a hundred miles to the south-east, he
changed the orders to a "General Chase," the ships to engage
as they came up; "to leeward," so as to get between
the enemy and his port, and "in rotation," by which probably
was meant that the leading British vessel should attack the
sternmost of the Spaniards, and that her followers should
pass her to leeward, successively engaging from the enemy's
rear towards the van.</p>

<p>At 4 P.M. the signal for battle was made, and a few minutes
later the four headmost of the pursuers got into action. At
4.40 one of the Spanish ships, the <i>Santo Domingo</i>, 80, blew
up with all on board, and at 6 another struck. By this
hour, it being January, darkness had set in. A night action
therefore followed, which lasted until 2 A.M., when the headmost
of the enemy surrendered, and all firing ceased. Of
the eleven hostile ships of the line, only four escaped. Besides
the one blown up, six were taken. These were the
<i>F&#233;nix</i>, 80, flag of the Spanish Admiral, Don Juan de Langara,
the <i>Monarca</i>, 70, the <i>Princesa</i>, 70, the <i>Diligente</i>, 70, the
<i>San
Julian</i>, 70, and the <i>San Eugenio</i>, 70. The two latter drove
ashore and were lost.<a id="footnotetag73" name="footnotetag73"></a><a href="#footnote73"><sup>73</sup></a> The remaining four were brought
into Gibraltar, and were ultimately added to the Navy.
All retained their old names, save the <i>F&#233;nix</i>, which was renamed
<i>Gibraltar</i>. "The weather during the night," by Rodney's
report, "was at times very tempestuous, with a great
sea. It continued very bad weather the next day, when the
<i>Royal George</i>, 100, <i>Prince George</i>, 90, <i>Sandwich</i>, 90
(Rodney's
flagship), and several other ships were in great danger, and
under the necessity of making sail to avoid the shoals of San
Lucar, nor did they get into deep water till the next morning."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span>

<p>It was in this danger from a lee shore, which was deliberately
though promptly incurred, that the distinction of this
action of Rodney's consists. The enemy's squadron, being
only eleven ships of the line, was but half the force of the
British, and it was taken by surprise; which, to be sure, is
no excuse for a body of war-ships in war-time. Caught unawares,
the Spaniards took to flight too late. It was Rodney's
merit, and no slight one under the conditions of weather
and navigation, that they were not permitted to retrieve their
mistake. His action left nothing to be desired in resolution
or readiness. It is true that Rodney discussed the matter
with his flag-captain, Walter Young, and that rumor attributed
the merit of the decision to the latter; but this sort
of detraction is of too common occurrence to affect opinion.
Sir Gilbert Blane, Physician to the Fleet, gives the following
account: "When it was close upon sunset, it became a question
whether the chase should be continued. After some discussion
between the Admiral and Captain, at which I was
present, the Admiral being confined with the gout, it was
decided to persist in the same course, with the signal to engage
to leeward." Rodney at that time was nearly sixty-two,
and a constant martyr to gout in both feet and hands.</p>

<p>The two successes by the way imparted a slightly triumphal
character to the welcome of the Admiral by the garrison,
then sorely in need of some good news. The arrival of much-needed
supplies from home was itself a matter of rejoicing;
but it was more inspiriting still to see following in the train
of the friendly fleet five hostile ships of the line, one of them
bearing the flag of a Commander-in-Chief, and to hear that,
besides these, three more had been sunk or destroyed. The
exultation in England was even greater, and especially at
the Admiralty, which was labouring under the just indignation
of the people for the unpreparedness of the Navy.
"You have taken more line-of-battle ships," wrote the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>
First Lord to Rodney, "than had been captured in any one
action in either of the two last preceding wars."</p>

<p>It should be remembered, too, as an element in the triumph,
that this advantage over an exposed detachment had been
snatched, as it were, in the teeth of a main fleet superior to
Rodney's own; for twenty Spanish and four French ships
of the line, under Admiral de Cordova, were lying then in
Cadiz Bay. During the eighteen days when the British
remained in and near the Straits, no attempt was made by
Cordova to take revenge for the disaster, or to reap the benefit
of superior force. The inaction was due, probably, to the
poor condition of the Spanish ships in point of efficiency and
equipment, and largely to their having uncoppered bottoms.
This element of inferiority in the Spanish navy should be
kept in mind as a factor in the general war, although Spanish
fleets did not come much into battle. A French Commodore,
then with the Spanish fleet in Ferrol, wrote as follows:
"Their ships all sail so badly that they can neither overtake
an enemy nor escape from one. The <i>Glorieux</i> is a bad sailer
in the French navy, but better than the best among the
Spaniards." He adds: "The vessels of Langara's squadron
were surprised at immense distances one from the other.
Thus they always sail, and their negligence and security on
this point are incredible."</p>

<p>On approaching Gibraltar, the continuance of bad weather,
and the strong easterly current of the Straits, set many of
Rodney's ships and convoy to leeward, to the back of the
Rock, and it was not till the 26th that the flagship herself
anchored. The storeships for Minorca were sent on at once,
under charge of three coppered ships of the line. The practice
of coppering, though then fully adopted, had not yet
been extended to all vessels. As an element of speed, it was
an important factor on an occasion like this, when time
pressed to get to the West Indies; as it also was in an engagement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span>
The action on the 16th had been opened by the coppered
ships of the line, which first overtook the retreating
enemy and brought his rear to battle. In the French navy
at the time, Suffren was urging the adoption upon an apparently
reluctant Minister. It would seem to have been
more general among the British, going far to compensate for
the otherwise inferior qualities of their ships. "The Spanish
men-of-war we have taken," wrote Rodney to his wife concerning
these prizes, "are much superior to ours." It may
be remembered that Nelson, thirteen years later, said the
same of the Spanish vessels which came under his observation.
"I never saw finer ships." "I perceive you cry out
loudly for coppered ships," wrote the First Lord to Rodney
after this action; "and I am therefore determined to stop
your mouth. You shall have copper enough."</p>

<p>Upon the return of the Minorca ships, Rodney put to sea
again on the 13th of February, for the West Indies. The
detachment from the Channel fleet accompanied him three
days' sail on his way, and then parted for England with the
prizes. On this return voyage it fell in with fifteen French
supply vessels, convoyed by two 64's, bound for the
Ile de France,<a id="footnotetag74" name="footnotetag74"></a><a href="#footnote74"><sup>74</sup></a> in the Indian Ocean. One of the ships of
war, the <i>Prot&#233;e</i>, and three of the storeships were taken.
Though trivial, the incident illustrates the effect of operations
in Europe upon war in India. It may be mentioned here
as indicative of the government's dilemmas, that Rodney
was censured for having left one ship of the line at the Rock.
"It has given us the trouble <i>and risk</i> of sending a frigate on
purpose to order her home immediately; and if you will
look into your original instructions, you will find that there
was no point more strongly guarded against than that of
your leaving any line-of-battle ship behind you." These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span>
words clearly show the exigency and peril of the general
situation, owing to the inadequate development of the naval
force as compared with its foes. Such isolated ships ran the
gantlet of the fleets in Cadiz, Ferrol, and Brest flanking the routes.</p>

<h3>RODNEY AND DE GUICHEN'S NAVAL CAMPAIGN
IN WEST INDIES. DE GUICHEN RETURNS TO
EUROPE, AND RODNEY GOES TO NEW YORK.
LORD CORNWALLIS IN THE CAROLINAS. TWO
NAVAL ACTIONS OF COMMODORE CORNWALLIS. RODNEY RETURNS TO WEST INDIES</h3>


<p>When Rodney arrived at Santa Lucia with his
four ships of the line, on March 27, 1780,
he found there a force of sixteen others, composed
in about equal proportions of ships that
had left England with Byron in the summer of 1778, and of
a reinforcement brought by Rear-Admiral Rowley in the spring of 1779.</p>

<p>During the temporary command of Rear-Admiral Hyde
Parker, between the departure of Byron and the arrival of
Rodney, a smart affair had taken place between a detachment
of the squadron and one from the French division,
under La Motte-Picquet, then lying in Fort Royal, Martinique.</p>

<p>On the 18th of December, 1779, between 8 and 9 A.M.,
the British look-out ship, the <i>Preston</i>, 50, between Martinique
and Santa Lucia made signal for a fleet to windward,
which proved to be a body of French supply ships, twenty-six
in number, under convoy of a frigate. Both the British
and the French squadrons were in disarray, sails unbent,
ships on the heel or partially disarmed, crews ashore for
wood and water. In both, signals flew at once for certain
ships to get under way, and in both the orders were executed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>
with a rapidity gratifying to the two commanders, who also
went out in person. The British, however, were outside
first, with five sail of the line and a 50-gun ship. Nine of
the supply vessels were captured by them, and four forced
ashore. The French Rear-Admiral had by this time got
out of Fort Royal with three ships of the line,&mdash;the <i>Annibal</i>,
74, <i>Vengeur</i>, 64, and <i>R&#233;fl&#233;chi</i>, 64,&mdash;and, being to windward,
covered the entrance of the remainder of the convoy.
As the two hostile divisions were now near each other, with
a fine working breeze, the British tried to beat up to the
enemy; the <i>Conqueror</i>, 74, Captain Walter Griffith, being
ahead and to windward of her consorts. Coming within
range at 5, firing began between her and the French flagship,
<i>Annibal</i>, 74, and subsequently between her and all the
three vessels of the enemy. Towards sunset, the <i>Albion</i>,
74, had got close up with the <i>Conqueror</i>, and the other ships
were within distant range; "but as they had worked not
only well within the dangers of the shoals of the bay (Fort
Royal), but within reach of the batteries, I called them off
by night signal at a quarter before seven."<a id="footnotetag75" name="footnotetag75"></a><a href="#footnote75"><sup>75</sup></a> In this chivalrous
skirmish,&mdash;for it was little more, although the injury
to the French in the loss of the convoy was notable,&mdash;Parker
was equally delighted with his own squadron and with his
enemy. "The steadiness and coolness with which on every
tack the <i>Conqueror</i> received the fire of these three ships, and
returned her own, working his ship with as much exactness
as if he had been turning into Spithead, and on every
board gaining on the enemy, gave me infinite pleasure. It
was with inexpressible concern," he added, "that I heard that
Captain Walter Griffith, of the <i>Conqueror</i>, was killed by the
last broadside."<a id="footnotetag76" name="footnotetag76"></a><a href="#footnote76"><sup>76</sup></a> Having occasion, a few days later, to
exchange a flag of truce with the French Rear-Admiral, he
wrote to him; "The conduct of your Excellency in the affair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>
of the 18th of this month fully justifies the reputation which
you enjoy among us, and I assure you that I could not witness
without envy the skill you showed on that occasion.
Our enmity is transient, depending upon our masters; but
your merit has stamped upon my heart the greatest admiration
for yourself." This was the officer who was commonly
known in his time as "Vinegar" Parker; but these letters
show that the epithet fitted the rind rather than the kernel.</p>

<p>Shortly after de Guichen<a id="footnotetag77" name="footnotetag77"></a><a href="#footnote77"><sup>77</sup></a> took command, in March, 1780,
he arranged with the Marquis de Bouill&#233;, Governor of Martinique,
to make a combined attack upon some one of the
British West India Islands. For this purpose three thousand
troops were embarked in the fleet, which sailed on the night
of the 13th of April, 1780, intending first to accompany a
convoy for Santo Domingo, until it was safely out of reach
of the British. Rodney, who was informed at once of the
French departure, put to sea in chase with all his ships,
twenty of the line, two of which were of 90 guns, and on the
16th came in sight of the enemy to leeward (westward) of
Martinique, beating up against the north-east trade-winds,
and intending to pass through the channel between that
island and Dominica. "A general chase to the north-west
followed, and at five in the evening we plainly discovered that
they consisted of twenty-three sail of the line, and one 50 gun ship."<a id="footnotetag78" name="footnotetag78"></a><a href="#footnote78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<p>As it fell dark Rodney formed his line of battle, standing
still to the north-west, therefore on the starboard tack;
and he was attentive to keep to windward of the enemy,
whom his frigates watched diligently during the night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span>
"Their man&oelig;uvres," he wrote, "indicated a wish to avoid
battle," and he therefore was careful to counteract them.
At daylight of April 17th, they were seen forming line of
battle, on the port tack, four or five leagues to leeward,&mdash;that
is, to the westward. The wind being east, or east by
north, the French would be heading south-south-east (Fig.
1, aa). The British order now was rectified by signal from
the irregularities of darkness, the ships being directed to
keep two cables'<a id="footnotetag79" name="footnotetag79"></a><a href="#footnote79"><sup>79</sup></a> lengths apart, and steering as before to
the northward and westward. At 7 A.M., considering this
line too extended, the Admiral closed the intervals to one
cable (aa). The two fleets thus were passing on nearly
parallel lines, but in opposite directions, which tended to
bring the whole force of Rodney, whose line was better and
more compact than the enemy's, abreast the latter's rear,
upon which he intended to concentrate. At 8 A.M. he made
general signal that this was his purpose; and at 8.30, to
execute it, he signalled for the ships to form line abreast,
bearing from each other south by east and north by west,
and stood down at once upon the enemy (Fig. 1, bb). The
object of the British being evident, de Guichen made his
fleet wear together to the starboard tack (bb). The French
rear thus became the van, and their former van, which was
stretched too far for prompt assistance to the threatened
rear, now headed to support it.</p>

<p>Rodney, baulked in his first spring, hauled at once to the
wind on the port tack (Fig. 1, <i>cc</i>), again contrary to the
French, standing thus once more along their line, for their
new rear. The intervals were opened out again to two cables.
The fleets thus were passing once more on parallel
lines, each having reversed its order; but the British still
retained the advantage, on whatever course and interval,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>
that they were much more compact than the French, whose
line, by Rodney's estimate, extended four leagues in length.<a id="footnotetag80" name="footnotetag80"></a><a href="#footnote80"><sup>80</sup></a>
The wariness of the two combatants, both trained in the
school of the eighteenth century with its reverence for the
line of battle, will appear to the careful reader. Rodney,
although struggling through this chrysalis stage to the later
vigor, and seriously bent on a deadly blow, still was constrained
by the traditions of watchful fencing. Nor was
his caution extravagant; conditions did not justify yet the
apparent recklessness of Nelson's tactics. "The different
movements of the enemy," he wrote, "obliged me to be very
attentive, and watch every opportunity that offered of attacking
them to advantage."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/132.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/132.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Rodney and De Guichen, April 17, 1780, Figures 1 and 2</div>

<p>The two fleets continued to stand on opposite parallel
courses&mdash;the French north by west, the British south by east&mdash;until
the flagship <i>Sandwich</i>, 90, (Fig. 2, S^1) was abreast
the <i>Couronne</i>, 80, (C), the flagship of de Guichen. Then,
at 10.10 A.M., the signal was made to wear together, forming
on the same tack as the enemy. There being some delay in
execution, this had to be repeated, and further enforced by
the pennant of the <i>Stirling Castle</i>, which, as the rear ship,
should begin the evolution. At half-past ten, apparently,
the fleet was about (Fig. 2, aa), for an order was then given
for rectifying the line, still at two cables. At 11 A.M. the
Admiral made the signal to prepare for battle, "to convince
the whole fleet I was determined to bring the enemy to an
engagement,"<a id="footnotetag81" name="footnotetag81"></a><a href="#footnote81"><sup>81</sup></a> and to this succeeded shortly the order to
alter the course to port (bb), towards the enemy.<a id="footnotetag82" name="footnotetag82"></a><a href="#footnote82"><sup>82</sup></a> Why he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span>
thought that any of the fleet should have required such
assurance cannot certainly be said. Possibly, although he
had so recently joined, he had already detected the ill-will,
or the slackness, of which he afterwards complained; possibly
he feared that the wariness of his tactics might lead men
to believe that he did not mean to exceed the lukewarm and
indecisive action of days scarce yet passed away, which had
led Suffren to stigmatize tactics as a mere veil, behind which
timidity thinks to hide its nakedness.</p>

<p>At 11.50 A.M. the decisive signal was made "for every
ship to bear down, and steer for <i>her opposite in the enemy's
line</i>, agreeable to the 21st article of the Additional Fighting
Instructions." Five minutes later, when the ships, presumably,
had altered their course for the enemy, the signal
for battle was made, followed by the message that the Admiral's
intention was to engage closely; he expecting, naturally,
that every ship would follow the example he purposed
to set. The captain of the ship which in the formation
(aa) had been the leader, upon whose action depended
that of those near her, unfortunately understood Rodney's
signal to mean that he was to attack the enemy's leader,
not the ship opposite to him at the moment of bearing
away. This ship, therefore, diverged markedly from the
Admiral's course, drawing after her many of the van. A
few minutes before 1 P.M., one of the headmost ships began
to engage at long range; but it was not till some time after
1 P.M. that the <i>Sandwich</i>, having received several broadsides,
came into close action (S^2) with the second vessel astern
from the French Admiral, the <i>Actionnaire</i>, 64. The latter
was soon beat out of the line by the superiority of the <i>Sandwich's</i>
battery, and the same lot befell the ship astern of her,&mdash;probably
the <i>Intr&#233;pide</i>, 74,&mdash;which came up to close the
gap. Towards 2.30 P.M., the <i>Sandwich</i>, either by her own
efforts to close, or by her immediate opponents' keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>
away, was found to be to leeward (S^3) of the enemy's line;
the <i>Couronne</i> (C) being on her weather bow. The fact was
pointed out by Rodney to the captain of the ship, Walter
Young, who was then in the lee gangway. Young, going
over to look for himself, saw that it was so, and that the
<i>Yarmouth</i>, 64, had hauled off to windward, where she lay
with her main and mizzen topsails aback. Signals were then
made to her, and to the <i>Cornwall</i>, 74, to come to closer engagement,
they both being on the weather bow of the flagship.</p>

<p>De Guichen, recognising this state of affairs, then or a
little later, attributed it to the deliberate purpose of the
British Admiral to break his line. It does not appear that
Rodney so intended. His tactical idea was to concentrate
his whole fleet on the French rear and centre, but there is
no indication that he now aimed at breaking the line. De
Guichen so construing it, however, gave the signal to wear
together, away from the British line. The effect of this, in
any event, would have been to carry his fleet somewhat to
leeward; but with ships more or less crippled, taking therefore
greater room to man&oelig;uvre, and with the exigency of re-forming
the line upon them, the tendency was exaggerated.
The movement which the French called wearing together was
therefore differently interpreted by Rodney. "The action
in the centre continued till 4.15 P.M., when M. de Guichen,
in the <i>Couronne</i>, the <i>Triomphant</i>, and the <i>Fendant</i>, after
engaging the <i>Sandwich</i> for an hour and a half, bore away.
The superiority of fire from the <i>Sandwich</i>, and the gallant
behavior of the officers and men, enabled her to sustain so
unequal a combat; though before attacked by them, she had
beat three ships out of their line of battle, had entirely broke
it, and was to leeward of the French Admiral." Possibly
the French accounts, if they were not so very meagre, might
dispute this prowess of the flagship; but there can be no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>
doubt that Rodney had set an example, which, had it been
followed by all, would have made this engagement memorable,
if not decisive. He reported that the captains, with very
few exceptions, had placed their ships improperly (cc). The
<i>Sandwich</i> had eighty shot in her hull, had lost her foremast
and mainyard, and had fired 3288 rounds, an average of
73 to each gun of the broadside engaged. Three of her hits
being below the water line, she was kept afloat with difficulty
during the next twenty-four hours. With the wearing
of the French the battle ceased.</p>

<p>In the advantage offered by the enemy, whose order was
too greatly extended, and in his own plan of attack, Rodney
always considered this action of April 17th, 1780, to have
been the great opportunity of his life; and his wrath was
bitter against those by whose misconduct he conceived it
had been frustrated. "The French admiral, who appeared
to me to be a brave and gallant officer, had the honour to
be nobly supported during the whole action. It is with
concern inexpressible, mixed with indignation, that the duty
I owe my sovereign and my country obliges me to acquaint
your Lordships that during the action between the French
fleet, on the 17th inst, and his Majesty's, the British flag
was not properly supported." Divided as the Navy was
then into factions, with their hands at each other's throats
or at the throat of the Admiralty, the latter thought it more
discreet to suppress this paragraph, allowing to appear only
the negative stigma of the encomium upon the French officers,
unaccompanied by any upon his own. Rodney, however, in
public and private letters did not conceal his feelings; and
the censure found its way to the ears of those concerned.
Subsequently, three months after the action, in a public
letter, he bore testimony to the excellent conduct of five of
the captains, Walter Young, of the flagship, George Bowyer
of the <i>Albion</i>, John Douglas of the <i>Terrible</i>, John Houlton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>
of the <i>Montagu</i>, and A.J.P. Molloy<a id="footnotetag83" name="footnotetag83"></a><a href="#footnote83"><sup>83</sup></a> of the <i>Trident</i>. "To
them I have given certificates, under my hand," "free
and unsolicited." Beyond these, "no consideration in life
would induce" him to go; and the two junior flag-officers
were implicitly condemned in the words, "to inattention
to signals, both in the van and rear divisions, is to be attributed
the loss of that glorious opportunity (perhaps never
to be recovered) of terminating the naval contest in these
seas." These junior admirals were Hyde Parker and Rowley;
the latter the same who had behaved, not only so
gallantly, but with such unusual initiative, in Byron's
engagement. A singular incident in this case led him to a
like independence of action, which displeased Rodney. The
<i>Montagu</i>, of his division, when closing the French line, wore
against the helm, and could only be brought into action on
the wrong (port) tack. Immediately upon this, part of the
French rear also wore, and Rowley followed them of his
own motion. Being called to account by Rodney, he stated
the facts, justifying the act by the order that "the greatest
impression was to be made on the enemy's rear." Both parties soon wore back.</p>

<p>Hyde Parker went home in a rage a few weeks later. The
certificates to Bowyer and Douglas, certainly, and probably
to Molloy, all of Parker's division, bore the stinging words
that these officers "meant well, and would have done their
duty had they been permitted." It is stated that their ships,
which were the rear of the van division, were going down to
engage close, following Rodney's example, when Parker made
them a signal to keep the line. If this be so, as Parker's
courage was beyond all doubt, it was simply a recurrence of
the old superstition of the line, aggravated by a misunderstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>
of Rodney's later signals. These must be discussed,
for the whole incident is part of the history of the
British Navy, far more important than many an indecisive
though bloody encounter.</p>

<p>One of the captains more expressly blamed, Carkett of
the <i>Stirling Castle</i>, which had been the leading ship at the
time the signal to alter the course toward the enemy was
made, wrote to Rodney that he understood that his name
had been mentioned, unfavourably of course, in the public
letter. Rodney's reply makes perfectly apparent the point
at issue, his own plan, the ideas running in his head as he
made his successive signals, the misconceptions of the juniors,
and the consequent fiasco. It must be said, however,
that, granting the facts as they seem certainly to have occurred,
no misunderstanding, no technical verbal allegation,
can justify a military stupidity so great as that of which
he complained. There are occasions in which not only is
literal disobedience permissible, but literal obedience, flying
in the face of the evident conditions, becomes a crime.</p>

<p>At 8 in the morning, Rodney had made a general signal
of his purpose to attack the enemy's rear. This, having been
understood and answered, was hauled down; all juniors
had been acquainted with a general purpose, to which the
subsequent man&oelig;uvres were to lead. How he meant to
carry out his intention was evidenced by the consecutive
course of action while on that tack,&mdash;the starboard; when
the time came, the fleet bore up together, in line abreast,
standing for the French rear. This attempt, being balked
then by de Guichen's wearing, was renewed two hours later;
only in place of the signal to form line abreast, was made one
to alter the course to port,&mdash;towards the enemy. As this
followed immediately upon that to prepare for battle, it
indicated almost beyond question, that Rodney wished, for
reasons of the moment, to run down at first in a slanting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>
direction,&mdash;not in line abreast, as before,&mdash;ships taking
course and interval from the flagship. Later again, at 11.50,
the signal was made, "agreeable to the 21st Article of the
Additional Fighting Instructions, for every ship to steer for
her opposite in the enemy's line;" and here the trouble began.
Rodney meant the ship opposite when the signal was
hauled down. He had steered slanting, till he had gained
as nearly as possible the position he wanted, probably till
within long range; then it was desirable to cover the remaining
ground as rapidly and orderly as possible, for which purpose
the enemy's ship then abreast gave each of his fleet its
convenient point of direction. He conceived that his signalled
purpose to attack the enemy's rear, never having been
altered, remained imperative; and further, that the signal
for two cables' length interval should govern all ships, and
would tie them to him, and to his movements, in the centre.
Carkett construed "opposite" to mean opposite in numerical
order, British van ship against French van ship, wherever
the latter was. Rodney states&mdash;in his letter to Carkett&mdash;that
the French van was then two leagues away. "You led
to the van ship, notwithstanding you had answered my signals
signifying that it was my intention to attack the enemy's
rear; which signal I had never altered.... Your leading
in the manner you did, induced others to follow so bad an
example; and thereby, forgetting that the signal for the line
was only at two cables' length distance from each other,
the van division was led by you to more than two leagues'
distance from the centre division, which was thereby not properly supported."<a id="footnotetag84" name="footnotetag84"></a><a href="#footnote84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span>

<p>Carkett was the oldest captain in the fleet, his post commission
being dated March 12th, 1758. How far he may have
been excusable in construing as he did Fighting Instructions,
which originated in the inane conception that the supreme
duty of a Commander-in-Chief was to oppose ship to ship,
and that a fleet action was only an agglomeration of naval
duels, is not very material, though historically interesting.
There certainly was that in the past history of the British
Navy which extenuated the offence of a man who must have
been well on in middle life. But since the Fighting Instructions
had been first issued there had been the courts-martial,
also instructive, on Mathews, Lestock, Byng, Keppel, and
Palliser, all of which turned more or less on the constraint
of the line of battle, and the duty of supporting ships engaged,&mdash;above
all, an engaged Commander-in-Chief. Rodney
perhaps underestimated the weight of the Fighting Instructions
upon a dull man; but he was justified in claiming that
his previous signals, and the prescription of distance, created
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span>
at the least a conflict of orders, a doubt, to which there should
have been but one solution, namely: to support the ships
engaged, and to close down upon the enemy, as near as
possible to the Commander-in-Chief. And in moments of
actual perplexity such will always be the truth. It is like
marching towards the sound of guns, or, to use Nelson's
words, "<i>In case</i> signals cannot be understood, no captain
can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of an
enemy." The "In Case," however, needs also to be kept
in mind; and that it was Nelson who said it. Utterances
of to-day, like utterances of all time, show how few
are the men who can hold both sides of a truth firmly, without
exaggeration or defect. Judicial impartiality can be
had, and positive convictions too; but their combination is
rare. A two-sided man is apt also to be double-minded.</p>

<p>The loss of men in this sharp encounter was: British,
killed, 120, wounded, 354; French, killed, 222, wounded,
537.<a id="footnotetag85" name="footnotetag85"></a><a href="#footnote85"><sup>85</sup></a> This gives three French hit for every two British,
from which, and from the much greater damage received
aloft by the latter, it may be inferred that both followed
their usual custom of aiming, the British at the hull, the
French at the spars. To the latter conduced also the lee-gage,
which the French had. The British, as the attacking
party, suffered likewise a raking fire as they bore down.</p>

<p>Rodney repaired damages at sea, and pursued, taking
care to keep between Martinique and the French. The
latter going into Guadeloupe, he reconnoitred them there
under the batteries, and then took his station off Fort Royal.
"The only chance of bringing them to action," he wrote to
the Admiralty on the 26th of April, "was to be off that port
before them, where the fleet now is, in daily expectation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span>
their arrival." The French represent that he avoided them,
but as they assert that they came out best on the 17th, and
yet admit that he appeared off Guadeloupe, the claim is not
tenable. Rodney here showed thorough tenacity of purpose.
De Guichen's orders were "to keep the sea, so far as the force
maintained by England in the Windward Islands would permit,
without too far compromising the fleet intrusted to him."<a id="footnotetag86" name="footnotetag86"></a><a href="#footnote86"><sup>86</sup></a>
With such instructions, he naturally and consistently shrunk
from decisive engagement. After landing his wounded and
refitting in Guadeloupe, he again put to sea, with the intention
of proceeding to Santa Lucia, resuming against that
island the project which both he and De Bouill&#233; continuously
entertained. The latter and his troops remained with the fleet.</p>

<p>Rodney meantime had felt compelled to return momentarily
to Santa Lucia. "The fleet continued before Fort
Royal till the condition of many of the ships under my command,
and the lee currents,<a id="footnotetag87" name="footnotetag87"></a><a href="#footnote87"><sup>87</sup></a> rendered it necessary to anchor
in Choque Bay (Anse du Choc), St. Lucie, in order to put
the wounded and sick men on shore, and to water and refit
the fleet, frigates having been detached both to leeward and
to windward of every island, in order to gain intelligence of
the motions of the enemy, and timely notice of their approach
towards Martinique, the only place they could refit at in these
seas." In this last clause is seen the strategic idea of the
British Admiral: the French must come back to Martinique.</p>

<p>From the vigilance of his frigates it resulted that when the
look-outs of de Guichen, who passed to windward of Martinique
on the 7th of May, came in sight of Gros Ilet on the
9th, it was simply to find the British getting under way to meet
the enemy. During the five following days both fleets were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span>
engaged in constant movements, upon the character of which
the writers of each nation put different constructions. Both
are agreed, however, that the French were to windward
throughout, except for a brief hour on the 15th, when a
fleeting change of wind gave the British that advantage,
only to lose it soon again. They at once used it to force
action. As the windward position carries the power to
attack, and as the French were twenty-three to the British
twenty, it is probably not a strained inference to say that
the latter were chasing to windward, and the former avoiding
action, in favour, perhaps, of that ulterior motive, the
conquest of Santa Lucia, for which they had sailed. Rodney
states in his letter that, when the two fleets parted on the
20th of May, they were forty leagues to windward (eastward)
of Martinique, in sight of which they had been on the 10th.</p>

<p>During these days de Guichen, whose fleet, according to
Rodney, sailed the better, and certainly sufficiently well to
preserve the advantage of the wind, bore down more than
once, generally in the afternoon, when the breeze is steadiest,
to within distant range of the British. Upon this movement,
the French base the statement that the British Admiral
was avoiding an encounter; it is equally open to the
interpretation that he would not throw away ammunition
until sure of effective distance. Both admirals showed much
skill and mastery of their profession, great wariness also,
and quickness of eye; but it is wholly untenable to claim that
a fleet having the weather-gage for five days, in the trade-winds,
was unable to bring its enemy to action, especially
when it is admitted that the latter closed the instant the
wind permitted him to do so.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of May 15th, about the usual hour,
Rodney "made a great deal of sail upon the wind." The
French, inferring that he was trying to get off, which he
meant them to do, approached somewhat closer than on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span>
previous days. Their van ship had come within long range,
abreast the centre of the British, who were on the port tack
standing to the south-south-east, with the wind at east
(aa, aa). Here the breeze suddenly hauled to south-southeast
(wind b). The heads of all the ships in both fleets were
thus knocked off to south-west (s, s), on the port tack, but
the shift left the British rear, which on that tack led the
fleet, to windward of the French van. Rodney's signal
flew at once, to tack in succession and keep the wind of the
enemy; the latter, unwilling to yield the advantage, wore all
together (w), hauling to the wind on the starboard tack, and
to use Rodney's words, "fled with a crowd of sail" (a', a').</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/143.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/143.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Rodney and De Guichen, May 15, 1780</div>

<p>The British fleet tacking in succession after their leaders,
(t, t), the immediate result was that both were now standing
on the starboard tack,&mdash;to the eastward,&mdash;the British
having a slight advantage of the wind, but well abaft the
beam of the French (bb, bb). The result, had the wind held,
would have been a trial of speed and weatherliness. "His
Majesty's fleet," wrote Rodney, "by this man&oelig;uvre had
gained the wind, and would have forced the enemy to battle,
had it not at once changed six points (back to east, its former
direction,) when near the enemy, and enabled them to
recover that advantage." When the wind thus shifted
again, de Guichen tacked his ships together and stood across
the bows of the advancing enemy (cc, cc). The British
leader struck the French line behind the centre, and ran
along to leeward, the British van exchanging a close cannonade
with the enemy's rear. Such an engagement, two lines
passing on opposite tacks, is usually indecisive, even when
the entire fleets are engaged, as at Ushant; but where, as in
this case, the engagement is but partial, the result is naturally
less. The French van and centre, having passed the
head of the enemy, diverged at that point farther and farther
from the track of the on-coming British ships, which from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span>
the centre rearwards did not fire. "As the enemy were under
a press of sail, none but the van of our fleet could come in
for any part of the action without wasting his Majesty's
powder and shot, the enemy wantonly expending theirs
at such a distance as to have no effect." Here again the
French were evidently taking the chance of disabling the
distant enemy in his spars. The British loss in the action
of May 15th was 21 killed and 100 wounded.</p>

<p>The fleets continued their respective movements, each
acting as before, until the 19th, when another encounter
took place, of exactly the same character as the last, although
without the same preliminary man&oelig;uvring. On
that occasion the British, who in the interim had been reinforced
by one 74 and one 50-gun ship, lost 47 killed and
113 wounded. The result was equally indecisive, tactically
considered; but both by this time had exhausted their
staying powers. The French, having been absent from
Martinique since the 13th of April, had now but six days'
provisions.<a id="footnotetag88" name="footnotetag88"></a><a href="#footnote88"><sup>88</sup></a> Rodney found the <i>Conqueror, Cornwall</i>, and
<i>Boyne</i> so shattered that he sent them before the wind to
Santa Lucia, while he himself with the rest of the fleet stood
for Barbados, where he arrived on the 22d. The French
anchored on the same day at Fort Royal. "The English,"
says Chevalier, "stood on upon the starboard tack, to the
southward, after the action of the 19th, and the next day were
not to be seen." "The enemy," reported Rodney, "stood
to the northward with all the sail they could possibly press,
and were out of sight the 21st inst. The condition of his
Majesty's ships was such as not to allow a longer pursuit."</p>

<p>By their dexterity and vigilance each admiral had thwarted
the other's aims. Rodney, by a pronounced, if cautious, offensive
effort, had absolutely prevented the "ulterior object"
of the French, which he clearly understood to be Santa Lucia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span>
De Guichen had been successful in avoiding decisive action,
and he had momentarily so crippled a few of the British ships
that the fleet must await their repairs before again taking
the sea. The tactical gain was his, the strategic victory rested
with his opponent; but that his ships also had been much
maltreated is shown by the fact that half a dozen could not
put to sea three weeks later. The French admiral broke
down under the strain, to which was added the grief of losing
a son, killed in the recent engagements. He asked for his
recall. "The command of so large a fleet," he wrote, "is
infinitely beyond my capacity in all respects. My health cannot
endure such continual fatigue and anxiety." Certainly
this seems a tacit testimony to Rodney's skill, persistence,
and offensive purpose. The latter wrote to his wife: "For
fourteen days and nights the fleets were so near each other
that neither officers nor men could be said to sleep. Nothing
but the goodness of the weather and climate would have
enabled us to endure so continual a fatigue. Had it been
in Europe, half the people must have sunk under it. For my
part, it did me good."</p>

<p>Rodney stated also in his home letters that the action of
his subordinates in the last affairs had been efficient; but
he gave them little credit for it. "As I had given public
notice to all my captains, etc., that I expected implicit
obedience to every signal made, under the certain penalty
of being instantly superseded, it had an admirable effect;
as they were all convinced, after their late gross behaviour,
that they had nothing to expect at my hands but instant
punishment to those who neglected their duty. My eye on
them had more dread than the enemy's fire, and they knew
it would be fatal. No regard was paid to rank: admirals as
well as captains, if out of their station, were instantly reprimanded
by signals, or messages sent by frigates; and, in
spite of themselves, I taught them to be, what they had never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span>
been before,&mdash;<i>officers</i>." Rodney told his officers also that
he would shift his flag into a frigate, if necessary, to watch
them better. It is by no means obligatory to accept these
gross aspersions as significant of anything worse than the
suspiciousness prevalent throughout the Navy, traceable
ultimately to a corrupt administration of the Admiralty.
The latter, like the government of 1756, was open to censure
through political maladministration; every one feared that
blame would be shifted on to him, as it had been on to Byng,&mdash;who
deserved it; and not only so, but that blame would
be pushed on to ruin, as in his case. The Navy was honeycombed
with distrust, falling little short of panic. In this
state of apprehension and doubt, the tradition of the line
of battle, resting upon men who did not stop to study facts
or analyse impressions, and who had seen officers censured,
cashiered, and shot, for errors of judgment or of action,
naturally produced hesitations and misunderstandings. An
order of battle is a good thing, necessary to insure mutual
support and to develop a plan. The error of the century,
not then exploded, was to observe it in the letter rather than
in the spirit; to regard the order as an end rather than a
means; and to seek in it not merely efficiency, which admits
broad construction in positions, but preciseness, which is as
narrowing as a brace of handcuffs. Rodney himself, Tory
though he was, found fault with the administration. With
all his severity and hauteur, he did not lose sight of justice,
as is shown by a sentence in his letter to Carkett. "Could I
have imagined your conduct and inattention to signals had
proceeded from anything but error in judgment, I had certainly
superseded you, but God forbid I should do so for
error in judgment only,"&mdash;again an illusion, not obscure, to Byng's fate.</p>

<p>In Barbados, Rodney received certain information that
a Spanish squadron of twelve ships of the line, with a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span>
convoy of ten thousand troops, had sailed from Cadiz on
April 28th for the West Indies. The vessel bringing the news
had fallen in with them on the way. Rodney spread a line
of frigates "to windward, from Barbados to Barbuda," to
obtain timely warning, and with the fleet put to sea on the
7th of June, to cruise to the eastward of Martinique to intercept
the enemy. The latter had been discovered on the
5th by a frigate, fifty leagues east of the island, steering for
it; but the Spanish admiral, seeing that he would be reported,
changed his course, and passed north of Guadeloupe. On
the 9th he was joined in that neighbourhood by de Guichen,
who was able to bring with him only fifteen sail,&mdash;a fact
which shows that he had suffered in the late brushes quite
as severely as Rodney, who had with him seventeen of his twenty.</p>

<p>Having evaded the British, the allies anchored at Fort
Royal; but the Spanish admiral absolutely refused to join
in any undertaking against the enemy's fleet or possessions.
Not only so, but he insisted on being accompanied to leeward.
The Spanish squadron was ravaged by an epidemic, due to unsanitary
conditions of the ships and the uncleanliness of the
crews, and the disease was communicated to their allies.
De Guichen had already orders to leave the Windward Islands
when winter approached. He decided now to anticipate that
time, and on the 5th of July sailed from Fort Royal with the
Spaniards. Having accompanied the latter to the east end
of Cuba, he went to Cap Fran&#231;ois, in Ha&#239;ti, then a principal
French station. The Spaniards continued on to Havana.</p>

<p>At Cap Fran&#231;ois, de Guichen found urgent entreaties
from the French Minister to the United States, and from
Lafayette, to carry his fleet to the continent, where the clear-sighted
genius of Washington had recognised already that
the issue of the contest depended upon the navies. The
French admiral declined to comply, as contrary to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span>
instructions, and on the 16th of August sailed for Europe, with
nineteen sail of the line, leaving ten at Cap Fran&#231;ois. Sealed
orders, opened at sea, directed him to proceed to Cadiz,
where he anchored on the 24th of October. His arrival
raised the allied force there assembled to fifty-one sail of the
line, besides the ninety-five sugar and coffee ships which
he had convoyed from Ha&#239;ti. It is significant of the weakness
of Great Britain in the Mediterranean at that time, that these
extremely valuable merchant ships were sent on to Toulon,
instead of to the more convenient Atlantic ports, only five
ships of the line accompanying them past Gibraltar. The
French government had feared to trust them to Brest, even
with de Guichen's nineteen sail.</p>

<p>The allied operations in the Windward Islands for the season
of 1780 had thus ended in nothing, notwithstanding an
incontestable inferiority of the British to the French alone,
of which Rodney strongly complained. It was, however,
contrary to the intentions of the Admiralty that things so
happened. Orders had been sent to Vice-Admiral Marriot
Arbuthnot, at New York, to detach ships to Rodney; but
the vessel carrying them was driven by weather to the Bahamas,
and her captain neglected to notify Arbuthnot of his
whereabouts, or of his dispatches. A detachment of five
ships of the line under Commodore the Hon. Robert Boyle
Walsingham was detained three months in England, wind-bound.
They consequently did not join till July 12th.
The dispositions at once made by Rodney afford a very
good illustration of the kind of duties that a British Admiral
had then to discharge. He detailed five ships of the line
to remain with Hotham at Santa Lucia, for the protection
of the Windward Islands. On the 17th, taking with him
a large merchant convoy, he put to sea with the fleet for St.
Kitts, where the Leeward Islands "trade" was collecting
for England. On the way he received precise information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>
as to the route and force of the Franco-Spanish fleet under
de Guichen, of the sickness on board it, and of the dissension
between the allies. From St. Kitts the July "trade" was
sent home with two ships of the line. Three others, he wrote
to the Admiralty, would accompany the September fleet,
"and the remainder of the ships on this station, which are in
want of great repair and are not copper-bottomed, shall
proceed with them or with the convoy which their Lordships
have been pleased to order shall sail from hence in October
next." If these arrived before winter, he argued, they would
be available by spring as a reinforcement for the Channel
fleet, and would enable the Admiralty to send him an equivalent
number for the winter work on his station.</p>

<p>As de Guichen had taken the whole French homeward
merchant fleet from Martinique to Cap Fran&#231;ois and as the
height of the hurricane season was near, Rodney reasoned
that but a small French force would remain in Ha&#239;ti, and
consequently that Jamaica would not require all the British
fleet to save it from any possible attack. He therefore sent
thither ten sail of the line, notifying Vice-Admiral Sir Peter
Parker that they were not merely to defend the island, but
to enable him to send home its great trade in reasonable security.</p>

<p>These things being done by July 31st, Rodney, reasoning
that the allies had practically abandoned all enterprises in
the West Indies for that year, and that a hurricane might
at any moment overtake the fleet at its anchors, possibly
making for it a lee shore, went to sea, to cruise with the fleet
off Barbuda. His mind, however, was inclined already to
go to the continent, whither he inferred, correctly but mistakenly,
that the greater part of de Guichen's fleet would go,
because it should. His purpose was confirmed by information
from an American vessel that a French squadron of seven
ships of the line, convoying six thousand troops, had anchored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span>
in Narragansett Bay on the 12th of July. He started at once
for the coast of South Carolina, where he communicated with
the army in Charleston, and thence, "sweeping the southern
coast of America," anchored with fourteen ships of the line
at Sandy Hook, on the 14th of September, unexpected and
unwelcome to friends and foes alike.</p>

<p>Vice-Admiral Arbuthnot, being junior to Rodney, showed
plainly and with insubordination his wrath at this intrusion
into his command, which superseded his authority and divided
the prize-money of a lucrative station. This, however, was
a detail. To Washington, Rodney's coming was a deathblow
to the hopes raised by the arrival of the French division
at Newport, which he had expected to see reinforced by de
Guichen. Actually, the departure of the latter made immaterial
Rodney's appearance on the scene; but this Washington
did not know then. As it was, Rodney's force joined
to Arbuthnot's constituted a fleet of over twenty sail of the
line, before which, vigorously used, there can be little doubt
that the French squadron in Newport must have fallen. But
Rodney, though he had shown great energy in the West
Indies, and unusual resolution in quitting his own station for
a more remote service, was sixty-two, and suffered from gout.
"The sudden change of climate makes it necessary for me
to go on shore for some short time," he wrote; and although
he added that his illness was "not of such a nature as shall
cause one moment's delay in his Majesty's service," he probably
lost a chance at Rhode Island. He did not overlook
the matter, it is true; but he decided upon the information
of Arbuthnot and Sir Henry Clinton, and did not inspect the
ground himself. Nothing of consequence came of his visit;
and on the 16th of November he sailed again for the West
Indies, taking with him only nine sail of the line.</p>

<p>The arrival of de Ternay's seven ships at Newport was more
than offset by a British reinforcement of six ships of the line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span>
under Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves which entered New York
on July 13th,&mdash;only one day later. Arbuthnot's force was
thus raised to ten of the line, one of which was of 98 guns.
After Rodney had come and gone, the French division was
watched by cruisers, resting upon Gardiner's Bay,&mdash;a commodious
anchorage at the east end of Long Island, between
thirty and forty miles from Rhode Island. When a movement
of the enemy was apprehended, the squadron assembled
there, but nothing of consequence occurred during the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>The year 1780 had been one of great discouragement to the
Americans, but the injury, except as the lapse of time taxed
their staying power, was more superficial than real. The
successes of the British in the southern States, though undeniable,
and seemingly substantial, were involving them ever
more deeply in a ruinously ex-centric movement. They need
here only to be summarised, as steps in the process leading
to the catastrophe of Yorktown,&mdash;a disaster which, as
Washington said, exemplified naval rather than military power.</p>

<p>The failure of d'Estaing's attack upon Savannah in the
autumn of 1779<a id="footnotetag89" name="footnotetag89"></a><a href="#footnote89"><sup>89</sup></a> had left that place in the possession of the
British as a base for further advances in South Carolina and
Georgia; lasting success in which was expected from the
numbers of royalists in those States. When the departure
of the French fleet was ascertained, Sir Henry Clinton put
to sea from New York in December, 1779, for the Savannah
River, escorted by Vice-Admiral Arbuthnot. The details
of the operations, which were leisurely and methodical, will
not be given here; for, although the Navy took an active
part in them, they scarcely can be considered of major importance.
On the 12th of May, 1780, the city of Charleston
capitulated, between six and seven thousand prisoners being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span>
taken. Clinton then returned to New York, leaving Lord
Cornwallis in command in the south. The latter proposed
to remain quiet during the hot months; but the activity of
the American partisan troops prevented this, and in July
the approach of a small, but relatively formidable force, under
General Gates, compelled him to take the field. On the 16th
of August the two little armies met at Camden, and the Americans,
who were much the more numerous, but largely irregulars,
were routed decisively. This news reached General
Washington in the north nearly at the same moment that
the treason of Benedict Arnold became known. Although
the objects of his treachery were frustrated, the sorrowful
words, "Whom now can we trust?" show the deep gloom
which for the moment shadowed the constant mind of the
American Commander-in-Chief. It was just at this period,
too, that Rodney arrived at New York.</p>

<p>Cornwallis, not content with his late success, decided to
push on into North Carolina. Thus doing, he separated
himself from his naval base in Charleston, communication
with which by land he had not force to maintain, and could
recover effective touch with the sea only in Chesapeake Bay.
This conclusion was not apparent from the first. In North
Carolina, the British general did not receive from the inhabitants
the substantial support which he had expected, and
found himself instead in a very difficult and wild country, confronted
by General Greene, the second in ability of all the
American leaders. Harassed and baffled, he was compelled
to order supplies to be sent by sea to Wilmington, North
Carolina, an out-of-the-way and inferior port, to which he
turned aside, arriving exhausted on the 7th of April, 1781.
The question as to his future course remained to be settled.
To return to Charleston by sea was in his power, but to do
so would be an open confession of failure,&mdash;that he could
not return by land, through the country by which he had come&mdash;much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span>
the same dilemma as that of Howe and Clinton in
Philadelphia. To support him in his distress by a diversion,
Sir Henry Clinton had sent two successive detachments to
ravage the valley of the James River in Virginia. These
were still there, under the command of General Phillips;
and Cornwallis, in the circumstances, could see many reasons
that thither was the very scene to carry the British operations.
On the 25th of April, 1781, he left Wilmington, and a
month later joined the division at Petersburg, Virginia, then
commanded by Benedict Arnold; Phillips having died.
There, in touch now with his fate, we must leave him for the moment.</p>

<p>To complete the naval transactions of 1780, it is necessary
to mention briefly two incidents, trivial in themselves, but
significant, not only as associated with the greater movements
of the campaign, but as indicative of the naval policy of the
States which were at war. The two, though not otherwise
connected, have a certain unity of interest, in that the same
British officer commanded on both occasions.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in Byron's action off Grenada,
in July, 1779, the 64-gun ship <i>Lion</i> received such injuries that
her commander, Captain Cornwallis, had been compelled to
run down before the trade-winds to Jamaica, in order to save
her from capture. Since that time she had remained there,
as one of the squadron of Vice-Admiral Sir Peter Parker.
In March, 1780, still commanded by Cornwallis, she was making
an ordinary service cruise off the north side of Ha&#239;ti,
having in company the <i>Bristol</i>, 50, and the <i>Janus</i>, 44. On the
20th of March, off Monte Christi, a number of sail were
sighted to the eastward, which proved to be a French convoy,
on its way from Martinique to Cap Fran&#231;ois, protected by
La Motte-Picquet's squadron of two 74's, one 64, one
50, and a frigate. The French merchant ships were ordered
to crowd sail for their port, while the men-of-war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span>
chased to the north-west. La Motte-Picquet's flagship, the
<i>Annibal</i>, 74, got within range at 5 P.M., when a distant cannonade
began, which lasted till past midnight, and was resumed
on the following morning. From it the <i>Janus</i> was the
chief sufferer, losing her mizzen topmast and foretopgallant
mast. It falling nearly calm, the <i>Bristol</i> and <i>Lion</i> got out
their boats and were towed by them to her support. The two
other French ships of the line got up during the forenoon of
the 21st, so that the action that afternoon, though desultory,
might be called general.</p>

<p>The two opposing commodores differ in their expressed
opinions as to the power of the French to make the affair more
decisive. Some of La Motte-Picquet's language seems to
show that he felt the responsibility of his position. "The
<i>Janus</i>, being smaller and more easily worked, lay upon our
quarter and under our stern, where she did considerable
damage. A little breeze springing up enabled us (the <i>Annibal</i>)
to stand towards our own ships, which did everything
possible to come up and cover us, without which we should
have been <i>surrounded</i>." It is easy to see in such an expression
the reflection of the commands of the French Cabinet, to
economise the ships. This was still more evident in La
Motte-Picquet's conduct next day. On the morning of
the 22d, "at daylight we were within one and a half cannon-shot,
breeze fresh at the east-north-east, and I expected to
overtake the British squadron in an hour, when we perceived
four ships in chase of us. At 6.30 A.M. three were seen to
be men-of-war. This superiority of force compelled me to
desist, and to make signal to haul our wind for Cap Fran&#231;ois."
These three new-comers were the <i>Ruby</i>, 64, and two frigates,
the <i>Pomona</i>, 28, and <i>Niger</i>, 32. The comparison of forces,
therefore, would be: French, two 74's, one 64, one 50,
and one frigate, opposed to, British, two 64's, one 50,
and three frigates. La Motte-Picquet evidently did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span>
wait to ascertain the size of the approaching ships. His
courage was beyond all dispute, and, as Hyde Parker had said,
he was among the most distinguished of French officers; but,
like his comrades, he was dominated by the faulty theory of his government.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Janus</i> died a natural death during the
encounter. It may be interesting to note that the ship was
given to Nelson, who was recalled for that purpose from the
expedition to San Juan, Nicaragua, one of the minor operations
of the war. His health, however, prevented this command
from being more than nominal, and not long afterward
he returned to England with Cornwallis, in the <i>Lion</i>.</p>

<p>Three months later, Cornwallis was sent by Parker to
accompany a body of merchant ships for England as far as
the neighborhood of Bermuda. This duty being fulfilled,
he was returning toward his station, having with him two
74's, two 64's, and one 50, when, on the morning of
June 20, a number of sail were seen from north-east to east
(a); the British squadron (aa) then steering east, with the
wind at south-south-east. The strangers were a body of
French transports, carrying the six thousand troops destined
for Rhode Island, and convoyed by a division of seven ships
of the line&mdash;one 80, two 74's, and four 64's&mdash;under
the command of Commodore de Ternay. Two of the
ships of war were with the convoy, the other five very properly
to windward of it. The latter therefore stood on, across
the bows of the British, to rejoin their consorts, and then
all hauled their wind to the south-west, standing in column
(bb) towards the enemy. Cornwallis on his part had kept on
(b) to reconnoitre the force opposed to him; but one of his
ships, the <i>Ruby</i>, 64, was so far to leeward (b') that the French,
by keeping near the wind, could pass between her and her
squadron (b, b, b'). She therefore went about (t) and steered
southwest, on the port tack (c'), close to the wind. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span>
French, who were already heading the same way, were thus
brought on her weather quarter in chase. Cornwallis then
wore his division (w), formed line of battle on the same tack
as the others (c), and edged down towards the <i>Ruby</i>. If the
French now kept their wind, either the <i>Ruby</i> (c') must be cut
off, or Cornwallis, to save her, must fight the large odds against
him. De Ternay, however, did not keep his wind but bore
up,&mdash;yielded ground (cc). "The enemy," wrote Cornwallis,
"kept edging off and forming line, though within gunshot.
At 5.30 P.M., seeing we had pushed the French ships to leeward
sufficiently to enable the <i>Ruby</i>, on our lee bow, to join
us, I made the signal to tack." As the British squadron went
about to stand east again (d), the French, heading now west-south-west
(cc), hoisted their colours and opened fire in passing.
The <i>Ruby</i> kept on till she fetched the wake of the British
column (d'), when she too tacked. The French then tacked
also, in succession (d), and the two columns stood on for awhile
in parallel lines, exchanging shots at long range, the British
to windward. Cornwallis very properly declined further
engagement with so superior a force. He had already done
much in saving a ship so greatly exposed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/156.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/156.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Cornwallis and De Ternay, June 20, 1780</div>

<p>The account above followed is that of the British commander,
but it does not differ in essentials from the French,
whose captains were greatly incensed at the cautious action
of their chief. A French <i>commissaire</i> in the squadron, who
afterwards published his journal, tells that de Ternay a few
days later asked the captain of one of the ships what English
admiral he thought they had engaged, and received the reply,
"We have lost our opportunity of finding out." He gives
also many details of the talk that went on in the ships, which
need not be repeated. Chevalier points out correctly, however,
that de Ternay had to consider that an equal or even
a superior force might be encountered as Narragansett Bay
was approached, and that he should not risk crippling his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span>
squadron for such a contingency. The charge of six thousand
troops, under the then conditions, was no light responsibility,
and at the least must silence off-hand criticism now. Comment
upon his action does not belong to British naval history,
to which the firmness and seamanship of Captain Cornwallis
added a lasting glory. It may be noted that fifteen years
later, in the French Revolution, the same officer, then a Vice-Admiral,
again distinguished himself by his bearing in face
of great odds, bringing five ships safe off, out of the jaws of
a dozen. It illustrates how luck seems in many cases to
characterise a man's personality, much as temperament does.
Cornwallis, familiarly known as "Billy Blue" to the seamen
of his day, never won a victory, nor had a chance of winning
one; but in command both of ships and of divisions, he
repeatedly distinguished himself by successfully facing odds
which he could not overcome.</p>

<p>The year 1780 was uneventful also in European waters,
after Rodney's relief of Gibraltar in January. The detachment
of the Channel Fleet which accompanied him on that
mission returned safely to England. The "Grand Fleet,"
as it still was styled occasionally, cruised at sea from June 8th
to August 18th, an imposing force of thirty-one ships of the
line, eleven of them three-deckers of 90 guns and upwards.
Admiral Francis Geary was then Commander-in-Chief, but,
his health failing, and Barrington refusing to take the position,
through professed distrust of himself and actual distrust
of the Admiralty, Vice-Admiral George Darby succeeded
to it, and held it during the year 1781.</p>

<p>The most notable maritime event in 1780 in Europe was
the capture on August 9th of a large British convoy, two
or three hundred miles west of Cape St. Vincent, by the allied
fleets from Cadiz. As out of sixty-three sail only eight
escaped, and as of those taken sixteen were carrying troops
and supplies necessary for the West India garrisons, such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span>
disaster claims mention among the greater operations of war,
the success of which it could not fail to influence. Captain
John Moutray, the officer commanding the convoy, was
brought to trial and dismissed his ship; but there were not
wanting those who charged the misadventure to the Admiralty,
and saw in the captain a victim. It was the greatest
single blow that British commerce had received in war during
the memory of men then living, and "a general inclination
prevailed to lay the blame upon some individual, who might
be punished according to the magnitude of the object, rather
than in proportion to his demerit."<a id="footnotetag90" name="footnotetag90"></a><a href="#footnote90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

<p>During the year 1780 was formed the League of the Baltic
Powers, known historically as the Armed Neutrality, to exact
from Great Britain the concession of certain points thought
essential to neutral interests. The accession of Holland to
this combination, together with other motives of dissatisfaction,
caused Great Britain to declare war against the United
Provinces on the 20th of December. Orders were at once
sent to the East and West Indies to seize Dutch possessions
and ships, but these did not issue in action until the following year.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1780 the French Government, dissatisfied
with the lack of results from the immense combined
force assembled in Cadiz during the summer months, decided
to recall its ships, and to refit them during the winter for
the more extensive and aggressive movements planned for the
campaign of 1781. D'Estaing was sent from France for
the purpose; and under his command thirty-eight ships of
the line, in which were included those brought by de Guichen
from the West Indies, sailed on the 7th of November for
Brest. Extraordinary as it may seem, this fleet did not reach
its port until the 3d of January, 1781.</p>

such subjects. The specific "Additional Instructions" quoted by
Rodney appear not to have been found. Among those given prior

issued by Rodney in 1782 an article (No. 17, p. 227) is apparently
designed to prevent the recurrence of Carkett's mistake. This, like
one by Hawke, in 1756 (p. 217), prescribes the intended action
rather by directing that the line of battle shall not prevent each ship

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>NAVAL CAMPAIGN IN WEST INDIES IN 1781. CAPTURE OF ST. EUSTATIUS BY RODNEY. DE
GRASSE ARRIVES IN PLACE OF DE GUICHEN. TOBAGO SURRENDERS TO DE GRASSE</h3>


<p>Rodney, returning to the West Indies from New
York, reached Barbados on December 6th, 1780.
There he seems first to have learned of the disastrous
effects of the great October hurricanes
of that year. Not only had several ships&mdash;among
them two of the line&mdash;been wrecked, with the loss
of almost all on board, but the greater part of those which
survived had been dismasted, wholly or in part, as well as
injured in the hull. There were in the West Indies no docking
facilities; under-water damage could be repaired only
by careening or heaving-down. Furthermore, as Barbados,
Santa Lucia, and Jamaica, all had been swept, their supplies
were mainly destroyed. Antigua, it is true, had escaped, the
hurricane passing south of St. Kitts; but Rodney wrote home
that no stores for refitting were obtainable in the Caribbee
Islands. He was hoping then that Sir Peter Parker might
supply his needs in part; for when writing from Santa Lucia
on December 10th, two months after the storm, he was still
ignorant that the Jamaica Station had suffered to the full
as severely as the eastern islands. The fact shows not merely
the ordinary slowness of communications in those days, but
also the paralysis that fell upon all movements in consequence
of that great disaster. "The most beautiful island in the
world," he said of Barbados, "has the appearance of a country
laid waste by fire and sword."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>

<p>Hearing that the fortifications at St. Vincent had been
almost destroyed by the hurricane, Rodney, in combination
with General Vaughan, commanding the troops on the station,
made an attempt to reconquer the island, landing there on
December 15th; but the intelligence proved erroneous, and
the fleet returned to Santa Lucia. "I have only nine sail
of the line now with me capable of going to sea," wrote the
Admiral on the 22d, "and not one of them has spare rigging
or sails." In the course of January, 1781, he was joined by
a division of eight ships of the line from England, under the
command of Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood,&mdash;Nelson's
Lord Hood. These, with four others refitted during that
month, not improbably from stores brought in Hood's convoy
of over a hundred sail, raised the disposable force to twenty-one
ships of the line: two 90's, one 80, fifteen 74's, and three 64's.</p>

<p>On the 27th of January, an express arrived from England,
directing the seizure of the Dutch possessions in the Caribbean,
and specifying, as first to be attacked, St. Eustatius
and St. Martin, two small islands lying within fifty miles
north of the British St. Kitts. St. Eustatius, a rocky patch
six miles in length by three in breadth, had been conspicuous,
since the war began, as a great trade centre, where supplies
of all kinds were gathered under the protection of its neutral
flag, to be distributed afterwards in the belligerent islands
and the North American continent. The British, owing to
their extensive commerce and maritime aptitudes, derived
from such an intermediary much less benefit than their
enemies; and the island had been jealously regarded by
Rodney for some time. He asserted that when de Guichen's
fleet could not regain Fort Royal, because of its injuries received
in the action of April 17th, it was refitted to meet him
by mechanics and materials sent from St. Eustatius. On the
other hand, when cordage was to be bought for the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>
vessels after the hurricanes of 1780, the merchants of the
island, he said, alleged that there was none there; although,
when he took the island soon afterwards, many hundred tons
were found that had been long in stock.</p>

<p>Rodney and Vaughan moved promptly. Three days after
their orders arrived, they sailed for St. Eustatius. There
being in Fort Royal four French ships of the line, six British
were left to check them, and on the 3d of February the fleet
reached its destination. A peremptory summons from the
commander of a dozen ships of the line secured immediate
submission. Over a hundred and fifty merchant ships were
taken; and a convoy of thirty sail, which had left the island
two days before, was pursued and brought back. The
merchandise found was valued at over £3,000,000. The
neighbouring islands of St. Martin and Saba were seized also at this time.</p>

<p>Rodney's imagination, as is shown in his letters, was greatly
impressed by the magnitude of the prize and by the defenceless
condition of his capture. He alleged these as the motives
for staying in person at St. Eustatius, to settle the complicated
tangle of neutral and belligerent rights in the property involved,
and to provide against the enemy's again possessing
himself of a place now so equipped for transactions harmful
to Great Britain. The storehouses and conveniences provided
for the particular traffic, if not properly guarded, were
like fortifications insufficiently garrisoned. If they passed
into the hands of the enemy, they became sources of injury.
The illicit trade could start again at once in full force, with
means which elsewhere would have first to be created. There
were a mile and a half of storehouses in the lower town, he
said, and these he must leave at the least roofless, if not wholly demolished.</p>

<p>For such reasons he remained at St. Eustatius throughout
February, March, and April. The amount of money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span>
involved, and the arbitrary methods pursued by him and by
Vaughan, gave rise to much scandal, which was not diminished
by the King's relinquishing all the booty to the
captors, nor by the latters' professed disinterestedness. Men
thought they did protest too much. Meanwhile, other matters
arose to claim attention. A week after the capture, a
vessel arrived from the Bay of Biscay announcing that eight
or ten French sail of the line, with a large convoy, had been
seen on the 31st of December steering for the West Indies.
Rodney at once detached Sir Samuel Hood with eleven ships
of the line, directing him to take also under his command the
six left before Fort Royal, and to cruise with them to windward
of Martinique, to intercept the force reported. Hood
sailed February 12th. The particular intelligence proved
afterwards to be false, but Hood was continued on his duty.
A month later he was ordered to move from the windward to
the leeward side of the island, and to blockade Fort Royal
closely. Against this change he remonstrated, and the event
showed him to be right; but Rodney insisted, saying that
from his experience he knew that a fleet could remain off Fort
Royal for months without dropping to leeward, and that there
ships detached to Santa Lucia, for water and refreshments,
could rejoin before an enemy's fleet, discovered to windward,
could come up. Hood thought the Admiral's object was
merely to shelter his own doings at St. Eustatius; and he considered
the blockade of Fort Royal to be futile, if no descent
upon the island were intended. "It would doubtless have
been fortunate for the public," he remarked afterwards, "had
Sir George been with his fleet, as I am confident he would
have been to windward instead of to leeward, when de Grasse made his approach."</p>

<p>The preparations of the French in Brest were completed
towards the end of March, and on the 22d of that month
Rear-Admiral de Grasse sailed, having a large convoy under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span>
the protection of twenty-six ships of the line. A week later
six of the latter parted company, five under Suffren for the
East Indies and one for North America. The remaining
twenty continued their course for Martinique, which was
sighted on the 28th of April. Before sunset, Hood's squadron
also was discovered to leeward of the island, as ordered by
Rodney to cruise, and off the southern point,&mdash;Pointe des
Salines. De Grasse then hove-to for the night, but sent an
officer ashore both to give and to obtain intelligence, and to
reach an understanding for concerted action next day.</p>

<p>The French fleet consisted of one ship of 110 guns, three
80's, fifteen 74's, and one 64, in all 20 of the line, besides
three armed <i>en fl&#251;te</i>,<a id="footnotetag91" name="footnotetag91"></a><a href="#footnote91"><sup>91</sup></a> which need not be taken into account,
although they served to cover the convoy. Besides these
there were the four in Fort Royal, one 74 and three 64's, a
junction of which with the approaching enemy it was one
of Hood's objects to prevent. The force of the British was
one 90, one 80, twelve 74's, one 70, and two 64's: total, 17.
Thus both in numbers and in rates of ships Hood was inferior
to the main body alone of the French; but he had the
advantage of ships all coppered, owing to Rodney's insistence
with the Admiralty. He also had no convoy to worry him; but he was to leeward.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 29th, de Grasse advanced to
round the southern point of the island, which was the usual
course for sailing ships. Hood was too far to leeward to
intercept this movement, for which he was blamed by Rodney,
who claimed that the night had not been properly utilised by
beating to windward of Pointe des Salines.<a id="footnotetag92" name="footnotetag92"></a><a href="#footnote92"><sup>92</sup></a> Hood, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span>
other hand, said in a private letter: "I never once lost sight
of getting to windward, but it was totally impossible....
Had I fortunately been there, I must have brought the enemy
to close action upon more equal terms, or they must have
given up their transports, trade, etc." Hood's subsequent
career places it beyond doubt that had he been to windward
there would have been a severe action, whatever the result;
but it is not possible to decide positively between his statement
and Rodney's, as to where the fault of being to leeward
lay. The writer believes that Hood would have been to
windward, if in any way possible. It must be added that
the British had no word that so great a force was coming.
On this point Hood and Rodney are agreed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/164.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/164.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Island of Martinique</div>

<p>Under the conditions, the French passed without difficulty
round Pointe des Salines, the transports hugging the coast,
the ships of war being outside and to leeward of them. Thus
they headed up to the northward for Fort Royal Bay (Cul
de Sac Royal), Hood standing to the southward until after
10, and being joined at 9.20 by a sixty-four (not reckoned
in the list above) from Santa Lucia, making his force eighteen.
At 10.35 the British tacked together to the northward. The
two fleets were now steering the same way, the French van
abreast of the British centre. At 11 the French opened their
fire, to which no reply was made then. At 11.20, the British
van being close in with the shore to the northward of the Bay,
Hood tacked again together, and the enemy, seeing his convoy
secure, wore, also together, which brought the two lines
nearer, heading south. At this time the four French ships
in the Bay got under way and easily joined the rear of their
fleet, it having the weather-gage. The French were thus 24
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span>
to 18. As their shot were passing over the British, the latter
now began to reply. At noon Hood, finding that he could
not close the enemy, shortened sail to topsails and hove-to,
hoping by this defiance to bring them down to him. At
12.30 the French admiral was abreast of the British flagship,
and the action became general, but at too long range. "Never,
I believe," wrote Hood, "was more powder and shot thrown
away in one day before." The French continuing to stand
on, Hood filled his sails again at 1 P.M., as their van had
stretched beyond his.</p>

<p>As the leading ships, heading south, opened the channel
between Santa Lucia and Martinique, they got the breeze
fresher, which caused them to draw away from the centre.
Hood, therefore, at 1.34 made the signal for a close order,
and immediately afterwards ceased firing, finding not one in
ten of the enemy's shot to reach. The engagement, however,
continued somewhat longer between the southern&mdash;van&mdash;ships,
where, by the account of Captain Sutherland, who was
in that part of the line, four of the British were attacked very
smartly by eight of the French. The <i>Centaur</i>, <i>Russell</i>,
<i>Intrepid</i>, and <i>Shrewsbury</i> appear to have been the ships that
suffered most heavily, either in hull, spars, or crews. They
were all in the van on the southern tack. The <i>Russell</i>,
having several shot between wind and water, was with
difficulty kept afloat, the water rising over the platform of
the magazine. Hood sent her off at nightfall to St. Eustatius,
where she arrived on the 4th of May, bringing Rodney the
first news of the action, and of the numbers of the French
reinforcement. During the 30th Hood held his ground, still
endeavouring to get to windward of the enemy; but failing
in that attempt, and finding two of his squadron much disabled,
he decided at sunset to bear away to the northward,
because to the southward the westerly currents set so strong
that the crippled ships could not regain Santa Lucia. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
11th of May, between St. Kitts and Antigua, he joined Rodney,
who, after hurried repairs to the <i>Russell</i>, had left St. Eustatius
on the 5th, with that ship, the <i>Sandwich</i>, and the <i>Triumph</i>.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to criticise positively the conduct
of Hood and of de Grasse in this affair. It is clear that Hood
on the first day seriously sought action, though his force was
but three-fourths that of his foe. He tried first to take the
offensive, and, failing that, to induce his enemy to attack
frankly and decisively. Troude is doubtless correct in saying
that it was optional with de Grasse to bring on a general
engagement; and the writer finds himself in agreement
also with another French authority, Captain Chevalier, that
"Count de Grasse seems to have been too much preoccupied
with the safety of his convoy on the 29th, Admiral Hood having
shown himself much less circumspect on that day than
he was on the next. Notwithstanding our numerical superiority,
Count de Grasse kept near the land until all the convoy
were safe." He represents Hood as fencing cautiously
on the following day, keeping on the field, but avoiding a
decisive encounter. This differs somewhat from the version
of Hood himself, who mentions signalling a general chase to
windward at 12.30 P.M. of the 30th. The two statements are
not irreconcilable. Hood having coppered ships, had
the speed of the French, whose vessels, being partly coppered
and partly not, sailed unevenly. The British commander
consequently could afford to take risks, and he therefore
played with the enemy, watching for a chance. Hood was
an officer of exceptional capacity, much in advance of his
time. He thoroughly understood a watching game, and that
an opportunity might offer to seize an advantage over part
of the enemy, if the eagerness of pursuit, or any mishap,
caused the French to separate. From any dilemma that
ensued, the reserve of speed gave him a power of withdrawal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span>
in relying upon which he was right. The present writer
adopts here also Chevalier's conclusion: "Admiral Hood evidently
had the very great advantage over his enemy of commanding
a squadron of coppered ships. Nevertheless, homage
is due to his skill and to the confidence shown by him
in his captains. If some of his ships had dropped behind
through injuries received, he would have had to sacrifice them,
or to fight a superior force." This means that Hood for an
adequate gain ran a great risk; that he thoroughly understood
both the advantages and the disadvantages of his
situation; and that he acted not only with great skill, but
warily and boldly,&mdash;a rare combination. The British loss
in this affair was 39 killed, including Captain Nott, of the
<i>Centaur</i>, and 162 wounded. The French loss is given by
Chevalier as 18 killed and 56 wounded; by Beatson, as 119
killed and 150 wounded.</p>

<p>Rodney, having collected his fleet, proceeded south, and on
the 18th of May put into Barbados for water. Much anxiety
had been felt at first for Santa Lucia, which Hood's retreat
had uncovered. As was feared, the French had attacked it at
once, their fleet, with the exception of one or two ships,
going there, and twelve hundred troops landing at Gros Ilet
Bay; but the batteries on Pigeon Island, which Rodney had
erected and manned, kept them at arms' length. The works
elsewhere being found too strong, the attempt was abandoned.</p>

<p>At the same time, two French ships of the line and thirteen
hundred troops had sailed from Martinique against Tobago.
When de Grasse returned from the failure at Santa Lucia,
he learned that the British were at sea, apparently bound for
Barbados. Alarmed for his detachment before Tobago, he
again sailed with the fleet for that island on the 25th of May,
accompanied by three thousand more troops. Rodney
learned at Barbados of the attempt on Tobago, and on the
29th dispatched a squadron of six sail of the line, under Rear-Admiral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span>
Francis Samuel Drake, to support the defence.
On the 30th he heard that the French main fleet had been
seen to windward of Santa Lucia, steering south, evidently
for Tobago. On the same day Drake and de Grasse encountered
one another off the latter island, the French being
to leeward, nearest the land. Drake necessarily retired, and
on the morning of June 3d was again off Barbados, whereupon
Rodney at once sailed for Tobago with the whole fleet.
On the 4th the island was sighted, and next morning information
was received that it had capitulated on the 2d.</p>

<p>The two fleets returning north were in presence of one
another on the 9th; but no engagement took place. Rodney,
who was to windward, having twenty sail to twenty-three,<a id="footnotetag93" name="footnotetag93"></a><a href="#footnote93"><sup>93</sup></a>
was unwilling to attack unless he could get a clear sea. The
strength of the currents, he said, would throw his fleet too
far to leeward, in case of reverse, into the foul ground between
St. Vincent and Grenada, thus exposing Barbados, which
had not recovered sufficiently from the hurricane to stand
alone. He therefore put into Barbados. De Grasse went
to Martinique to prepare the expedition to the American
continent, which resulted in the surrender of Cornwallis at
Yorktown. On the 5th of July he sailed from Fort Royal
taking with him the "trade" for France, and on the 26th
anchored with it at Cap Fran&#231;ois in Ha&#239;ti, where he found a
division of four ships of the line which had been left the year
before by de Guichen. There also was a frigate, which had
left Boston on the 20th of June, and by which De Grasse
received dispatches from Washington, and from Rochambeau,
the general commanding the French troops in America.
These acquainted him with the state of affairs on the continent,
and requested that the fleet should come to either the
Chesapeake or New York, to strike a decisive blow at the
British power in one quarter or the other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>NAVAL OPERATIONS PRECEDING AND DETERMINING THE FALL OF YORKTOWN. CORNWALLIS
SURRENDERS<br />

1781</h3>


<p>Having now brought the major naval transactions
in the West Indies to the eve of the great
events which determined the independence of
the American States, it is expedient here to
resume the thread of operations, both sea and land, on the
American continent, so as to bring these also up to the same
decisive moment, when the military and naval blended and
in mutual support forced the surrender of the British army
at Yorktown under Lord Cornwallis.</p>

<p>It has been said that, to support the operations of Cornwallis
in the Carolinas, Clinton had begun a series of diversions
in the valley of the James River.<a id="footnotetag94" name="footnotetag94"></a><a href="#footnote94"><sup>94</sup></a> The first detachment
so sent, under General Leslie, had been transferred
speedily to South Carolina, to meet the exigencies of
Cornwallis's campaign. The second, of sixteen hundred
troops under Benedict Arnold, left New York at the end of
December, and began its work on the banks of the James at
the end of January, 1781. It advanced to Richmond, nearly
a hundred miles from the sea, wasting the country round
about, and finding no opposition adequate to check its freedom
of movement. Returning down stream, on the 20th it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span>
occupied Portsmouth, south of the James River; near the
sea, and valuable as a naval station.</p>

<p>Washington urged Commodore des Touches, who by de
Ternay's death had been left in command of the French
squadron at Newport, to interrupt these proceedings, by
dispatching a strong detachment to Chesapeake Bay; and
he asked Rochambeau also to let some troops accompany the
naval division, to support the scanty force which he himself
could spare to Virginia. It happened, however, that a gale
of wind just then had inflicted severe injury upon Arbuthnot's
squadron, three of which had gone to sea from Gardiner's
Bay upon a report that three French ships of the line had
left Newport to meet an expected convoy. One seventy-four,
the <i>Bedford</i>, was wholly dismasted; another, the
<i>Culloden</i>, drove ashore on Long Island and was wrecked.
The French ships had returned to port the day before the gale,
but the incident indisposed des Touches to risk his vessels
at sea at that time. He sent only a sixty-four, with two
frigates. These left Newport on February 9th, and entered
the Chesapeake, but were unable to reach the British vessels,
which, being smaller, withdrew up the Elizabeth River. Arbuthnot,
hearing of this expedition, sent orders to some frigates
off Charleston to go to the scene. The French division,
when leaving the Bay, met one of these, the <i>Romulus</i>, 44, off
the Capes, captured her, and returned to Newport on February
25th. On the 8th of March, Arnold reported to
Clinton that the Chesapeake was clear of French vessels.</p>

<p>On the same day Arbuthnot also was writing to Clinton,
from Gardiner's Bay, that the French were evidently preparing
to quit Newport. His utmost diligence had failed
as yet to repair entirely the damage done his squadron by
the storm, but on the 9th it was ready for sea. On the
evening of the 8th the French had sailed. On the 10th Arbuthnot
knew it, and, having taken the precaution to move
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg 171]</span>
down to the entrance of the bay, he was able to follow at
once. On the 13th he spoke a vessel which had seen the
enemy and gave him their course. Favoured by a strong
north-west wind, and his ships being coppered, he outstripped
the French, only three of which had coppered bottoms.
At 6 A.M. of March 16th a British frigate reported
that the enemy were astern&mdash;to the north-east&mdash;about
a league distant, a thick haze preventing the squadron
from seeing them even at that distance (A, A). Cape
Henry, the southern point of the entrance to the Chesapeake,
then bore southwest by west, distant forty miles. The
wind as stated by Arbuthnot was west; by the French, south-west.</p>

<p>The British admiral at once went about, steering in the
direction reported, and the opposing squadrons soon sighted
one another. The French finding the British between them
and their port, hauled to the wind, which between 8 and 9
shifted to north by west, putting them to windward. Some
preliminary man&oelig;uvres then followed, both parties seeking
the weather-gage. The weather remained thick and squally,
often intercepting the view; and the wind continued to shift
until towards noon, when it settled at north-east. The
better sailing, or the better seamanship, of the British had
enabled them to gain so far upon their opponents that at
1 P.M. they were lying nearly up in their wake, on the port
tack, overhauling them; both squadrons in line of battle,
heading east-south-east, the French bearing from their
pursuers east by south,&mdash;one point on the weather bow (B, B).
The wind was rising with squalls, so that the ships lay over
well to their canvas, and the sea was getting big.</p>

<p>As the enemy now was threatening his rear, and had the
speed to overtake, des Touches felt it necessary to resort to the
usual parry to such a thrust, by wearing his squadron and
passing on the other tack. This could be done either together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span>
reversing the order of the ships, or in succession, preserving
the natural order; depending much upon the distance of the
enemy. Having room enough, des Touches chose the latter,
but, as fighting was inevitable, he decided also to utilise the
man&oelig;uvre by surrendering the weather-gage, and passing
to leeward. The advantage of this course was that, with the
existing sea and wind, and the inclination of the ships, the
party that had the opponent on his weather side could open
the lower-deck ports and use those guns. There was thus a
great increase of battery power, for the lower guns were the
heaviest. Des Touches accordingly put his helm up, his line
passing in succession to the southward (c) across the head
of the advancing British column, and then hauling up so as to
run parallel to the latter, to leeward, with the wind four points free.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/172.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/172.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Arbuthnot and Des Touches, March 16, 1781</div>

<p>Arbuthnot accepted the position offered, stood on as he
was until nearly abreast of the French, and at 2 P.M. made
the signal to wear. It does not appear certainly how this
was executed; but from the expression in the official report,
"the van of the squadron wore in the line," and from the
fact that the ships which led in the attack were those which
were leading on the port tack,&mdash;the tack before the signal
was made,&mdash;it seems likely that the movement was made in
succession (a). The whole squadron then stood down into
action, but with the customary result. The ships in the van
and centre were all engaged by 2.30, so Arbuthnot states;
but the brunt of the engagement had already fallen upon the
three leading vessels, which got the first raking fire, and, as is
also usual, came to closer action than those which followed
them (C). They therefore not only lost most heavily in men,
but also were so damaged aloft as to be crippled. The
British Vice-Admiral, keeping the signal for the line flying,
and not hoisting that for close action, appears to have caused
a movement of indecision in the squadron,&mdash;an evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>
again of the hold which the line then still had upon men's
minds. Of this des Touches cleverly availed himself, by
ordering his van ships, which so far had borne the brunt, to
keep away together and haul up on the other tack (e), while
the ships behind them were to wear in succession; that is, in
column, one following the other. The French column then
filed by the three disabled British vessels (d), gave them their
broadsides one by one, and then hauled off to the eastward,
quitting the field (D). Arbuthnot made signal to wear in
pursuit, but the <i>Robust</i> and <i>Prudent</i>, two of the van ships,
were now wholly unmanageable from the concentration of
fire upon them caused by des Touches's last movement;
and the maintopsail yard of the <i>London</i>, the only British
three-decker, had been shot away. The chase therefore was
abandoned, and the squadron put into Chesapeake Bay, for
which the wind was fair (D). The French returned to Newport.
The respective losses in men were: British, 30 killed,
73 wounded; French, 72 killed, 112 wounded.</p>

<p>In this encounter, both sides had eight ships in line, besides
smaller craft. The advantage in force was distinctly with
the British, who had one three-decked ship, three 74's, three
64's, and a 50; while the French had one 84, two 74's, four
64's, and the late British <i>Romulus</i>, 44. Because of this
superiority, probably, the action was considered particularly
discreditable by contemporaries; the more so because several
vessels did not engage closely,&mdash;a fault laid to the British
admiral's failure to make the signal for close action, hauling
down that for the line. This criticism is interesting, for it
indicates how men's minds were changing; and it shows also
that Arbuthnot had not changed, but still lived in the
middle of the century. The French commodore displayed
very considerable tactical skill; his squadron was handled
neatly, quickly, and with precision. With inferior force he
carried off a decided advantage by sheer intelligence and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span>
good management. Unluckily, he failed in resolution to pursue
his advantage. He probably could have controlled the
Chesapeake had he persisted.</p>

<p>His neglect to do so was justified by Commodore de Barras,
who on the 10th of May arrived in Newport from France to
command the squadron. This officer, after pointing out the
indisputable tactical success, continued thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"As to the advantage which the English obtained, in fulfilling
their object, that is a necessary consequence of their superiority,
and, <i>still more</i>, of their purely defensive attitude. <i>It is a principle
in war that one should risk much to defend one's own positions, and
very little to attack those of the enemy.</i> M. des Touches, whose object
was purely offensive, could and should, when the enemy opposed to
him superior forces, renounce a project which could no longer succeed,
unless, <i>contrary to all probability</i>, it ended not only in beating
but also in <i>destroying entirely</i>, that superior squadron."
</p></blockquote>

<p>This exaltation of the defensive above the offensive, this
despairing view of probabilities, this aversion from risks, go
far to explain the French want of success in this war. No
matter how badly the enemy was thrashed, unless he were
entirely destroyed, he was still a fleet "in being," a paralysing factor.</p>

<p>The retreat of des Touches and the coming of Arbuthnot
restored to the British the command of Chesapeake Bay.
Clinton, as soon as he knew that the British and French
squadrons had sailed, had sent off a reinforcement of two
thousand troops for Arnold, under General Phillips. These
arrived in Lynnhaven Bay on March 26th, ten days after
the naval battle, and proceeded at once to Portsmouth,
Virginia. It is unnecessary to speak of the various operations
of this land force. On the 9th of May, in consequence
of letters received from Cornwallis, it moved to Petersburg.
There on the 13th Phillips died, the command reverting
momentarily to Arnold. On the 20th Cornwallis joined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span>
from Wilmington, North Carolina,<a id="footnotetag95" name="footnotetag95"></a><a href="#footnote95"><sup>95</sup></a> and Arnold soon after returned to New York.</p>

<p>Cornwallis now had with him about seven thousand troops,
including the garrison at Portsmouth; but a serious difference
of opinion existed between him and Clinton, the Commander-in-Chief.
The latter had begun the conquest of
South Carolina, and did not welcome the conclusion of his
lieutenant that the conquest could not be maintained away
from the seaboard, unless Virginia also were subdued;
for from there, a rich and populous region, men and supplies
supported the American cause in the south. Cornwallis
had tested the asserted strength of the Royalists in the
Carolinas, and had found it wanting. Offensive operations in
Virginia were what he wished; but Clinton did not approve
this project, nor feel that he could spare troops enough for
the purpose. Between October, 1780, and June, 1781, he
said, seven thousand seven hundred and twenty-four effectives
had been sent from New York to the Chesapeake; and he
could not understand the failure to cut off the greatly inferior
force of the enemy in Virginia. This at least did not indicate
probable success for a renewed offensive. The garrison
of New York was now short of eleven thousand and could not
be diminished further, as he was threatened with a siege.
In short, the British situation in America had become essentially
false, by the concurring effect of insufficient force and
ex-centric&mdash;double&mdash;operations. Sent to conquer, their
numbers now were so divided that they could barely maintain
the defensive. Cornwallis therefore was ordered to occupy
a defensive position which should control an anchorage for
ships of the line, and to strengthen himself in it. After
some discussion, which revealed further disagreement, he
placed himself at Yorktown, on the peninsula formed by the
James and York rivers. Portsmouth was evacuated, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span>
garrison reaching Yorktown on the 22d of August. Cornwallis's
force was then seven thousand troops; and there were
with him besides about a thousand seamen, belonging to
some half-dozen small vessels, which were shut up in the York
by the arrival from Ha&#239;ti of the French fleet under de Grasse,
which on August 30th, 1781, had anchored in Lynnhaven Bay, inside of Cape Henry.</p>

<p>On July 2d Arbuthnot had sailed for England, leaving
the command at New York to Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves.
Graves on the same day wrote to Rodney by the brig <i>Active</i>,
that intercepted dispatches of the enemy had revealed that a
large division from the West Indies was to arrive on the
American coast during the summer, to co&#246;perate with the
force already in Newport. Rodney, on the other hand,
dispatched to New York on July 7th the <i>Swallow</i> sloop, 16,
with word that, if he sent reinforcements from the West
Indies, they would be ordered to make the Capes of the
Chesapeake, and to coast thence to New York. He asked,
therefore, that cruisers with information might be stationed
along that route. Two days later, having then certain
news that de Grasse had sailed for Cap Fran&#231;ois, he sent
this intelligence to Sir Peter Parker at Jamaica, and gave
Sir Samuel Hood preparatory orders to command a reinforcement
of ships destined for the continent. This, however,
was limited in numbers to fifteen sail of the line, Rodney
being misled by his intelligence, which gave fourteen ships
as the size of the French division having the same destination,
and reported that de Grasse himself would convoy the
trade from Cap Fran&#231;ois to France. On the 24th instructions
were issued for Hood to proceed on this duty. He was
first to convoy the trade from Jamaica as far as the passage
between Cuba and Ha&#239;ti, and thence to make the utmost
speed to the Chesapeake. A false rumour, of French ships
reaching Martinique from Europe, slightly delayed this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span>
movement. The convoy was dispatched to Jamaica with
two ships of the line, which Sir Peter Parker was directed to
send at once to America, and requested to reinforce with
others from his own squadron. Hood was detained until
the rumour could be verified. On the 1st of August Rodney
sailed for England on leave of absence. On the 10th Hood
left Antigua with fourteen ships of the line, direct for the
Capes. He had already received, on August 3d, Graves's
letter by the <i>Active</i>, which he sent back on the 8th with his
answers and with a notification of his speedy departure.</p>

<p>The <i>Swallow</i> and the <i>Active</i> should have reached Graves
before Hood; but neither got to him at all. The <i>Swallow</i>
arrived safely in New York on the 27th of July; but Graves
had sailed with all his squadron on the 21st, for Boston Bay,
hoping there to intercept an expected convoy from France,
concerning which a special caution had been sent him by
the Admiralty. The <i>Swallow</i> was at once sent on by the
senior naval officer at New York, but was attacked by
hostile vessels, forced ashore on Long Island, and lost. The
<i>Active</i> was captured before she reached New York. Graves,
thus uninformed of the momentous crisis at hand, continued
cruising until the 16th of August, when he returned to Sandy
Hook. There he found the duplicates of the <i>Swallow's</i>
letters, but they only notified him of the course a reinforcement
would take, not that Hood had started. On August
25th the latter, being then off the Chesapeake, sent duplicates
of the <i>Active's</i> dispatches, but these preceded by little his
own arrival on the 28th. That evening news was received
in New York that de Barras had sailed from Newport on the
25th, with his whole division. Hood anchored outside the
Hook, where Graves, who was senior to him, undertook to
join at once. On the 31st five sail of the line and a 50-gun
ship, all that could be got ready in time, crossed the bar, and
the entire body of nineteen ships of the line started at once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span>
for the Chesapeake, whither it was understood now that both
the French fleet and the united armies of Washington and
Rochambeau were hurrying.</p>

<p>Count de Grasse upon his arrival at Cap Fran&#231;ois had found
that many things must be done before he could sail for the
continent. Measures needed to be taken for the security of
Ha&#239;ti; and a large sum of money, with a considerable reinforcement
of troops, was required to insure the success of the
projected operation, for which but a short time was allowed,
as it was now August and he must be again in the West Indies
in October. It was not the least among the fortunate
concurrences for the American cause at that moment, that
de Grasse, whose military capacity was not conspicuous,
showed then a remarkable energy, politic tact, and breadth
of view. He decided to take with him every ship he could
command, postponing the sailing of the convoys; and by
dexterous arrangement with the Spaniards he contrived to
secure both the funds required and an efficient corps of thirty-three
hundred French troops, without stripping Ha&#239;ti too
closely. On the 5th of August he left Cap Fran&#231;ois, with
twenty-eight ships of the line, taking the route through the
Old Bahama Channel,<a id="footnotetag96" name="footnotetag96"></a><a href="#footnote96"><sup>96</sup></a> and anchored in Lynnhaven Bay,
just within the entrance of the Chesapeake, on the 30th, the
day before Graves sailed from New York for the same place.
The troops were landed instantly on the south side of the
James River, and soon reached La Fayette, who commanded
the forces so far opposed to Cornwallis, which were thus
raised to eight thousand men. At the same time Washington,
having thrown Clinton off his guard, was crossing the Delaware
on his way south, with six thousand regular troops,
two thousand American and four thousand French, to join
La Fayette. French cruisers took position in the James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span>
River, to prevent Cornwallis from crossing, and escaping to
the southward into Carolina. Others were sent to close the
mouth of the York. By these detachments the main fleet
was reduced to twenty-four sail of the line.</p>

<p>On the 5th of September, at 8 A.M., the French look-out
frigate, cruising outside Cape Henry, made the signal for a
fleet steering for the Bay. It was hoped at first that this was
de Barras's squadron from Newport, known to be on its way,
but it was soon evident from the numbers that it must be
an enemy. The forces now about to be opposed, nineteen.
British sail of the line to twenty-four French, were constituted
as follows: British, two 98's (three-deckers); twelve
74's, one 70, four 64's, besides frigates; French, one 104
(three-decker),<a id="footnotetag97" name="footnotetag97"></a><a href="#footnote97"><sup>97</sup></a> three 80's, seventeen 74's, three 64's.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Chesapeake is about ten miles wide,
from Cape Charles on the north to Cape Henry on the south.
The main channel is between the latter and a shoal, three
miles to the northward, called the Middle Ground. The
British fleet, when the French were first seen from it, was
steering south-west for the entrance, under foresails and topgallant
sails, and it so continued, forming line as it approached.
The wind was north-north-east. At noon the ebb-tide made,
and the French began to get under way, but many of their
ships had to make several tacks to clear Cape Henry. Their
line was consequently late in forming, and was by no means
regular or closed as they got outside.</p>

<p>At 1 P.M. Graves made the signal to form column on an
east and west line, which with the wind as it was would be
the close-hauled line heading out to sea, on the other tack
from that on which his fleet still was. In this order he continued
to head in for the entrance. At 2 P.M. the French van,
standing out, three miles distant by estimate, bore south
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>
from the <i>London</i>, Graves's flagship, and was therefore
abreast of the centre of the British line. As the British van
came near the Middle Ground, at 2.13 P.M., the ships wore
together. This put them on the same tack as the French,
Hood's division, which had been leading, being now the rear
in the reversed order. The fleet then brought-to,&mdash;stopped,&mdash;in
order to allow the centre of the enemy to come abreast
of the centre of the British (aa, aa.) The two lines now were
nearly parallel, but the British, being five ships fewer,
naturally did not extend so far as the rear of the French,
which in fact was not yet clear of the Cape. At 2.30 Graves
made the signal for the van ship (the <i>Shrewsbury</i>), to lead
more to starboard (l)&mdash;towards the enemy. As each ship
in succession would take her course to follow the leader, the
effect of this was to put the British on a line inclined to that
of the enemy, the van nearest, and as the signal was renewed
three quarters of an hour later,&mdash;at 3.17,&mdash;this angle
became still more marked (bb).<a id="footnotetag98" name="footnotetag98"></a><a href="#footnote98"><sup>98</sup></a> This was the original and
enduring cause of a lamentable failure by which seven of the
rear ships, in an inferior force undertaking to attack, never
came into battle at all. At 3.34 the van was ordered again
to keep still more toward the enemy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/180.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/180.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Graves and De Grasse, September 5, 1781</div>

<p>At 3.46 the signal was made for ships to close to one cable,
followed almost immediately by that to bear down and engage
the enemy,&mdash;the signal for the line still flying. Graves's
flagship, the <i>London</i>, 98 (f), which was hove-to, filled and
bore down. Under the conditions, the van ships of course
got first under fire, and the action gradually extended from
them to the twelfth in the order, two ships astern of the
<i>London</i>. According to the log of the latter, at 4.11 the signal
for the line ahead was hauled down, that it might not interfere
with that for close action, but at 4.22 it was rehoisted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span>
"the ships not being sufficiently extended." The meaning
of this expression may be inferred from Beatson's account:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The <i>London</i>, by taking the lead, had advanced farther towards
the enemy than some of the ships stationed immediately ahead of her
in the line of battle; and upon luffing up (f') to bring her broadside
to bear, they having done the same thing, her second ahead (m)
was brought nearly upon her weather beam. The other ships ahead
of her were likewise too much crowded together."
</p></blockquote>

<p>As the ship on the <i>London's</i> weather beam could not fire
upon the enemy unless she drew ahead, this condition probably
accounts for the flagship being again hove-to, while
firing, as Hood says that she was. The signal for the line
was hauled down again at 4.27, by the <i>London's</i> log, that for
close action being up, and repeated at 5.20, when Hood (h) at
last bore down with his division (h'), but the French ships bearing
up also, he did not near them. Firing ceased shortly after
sunset. The loss of the British was 90 killed, 246 wounded;
that of the French is given only in round numbers, as about
200 killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Hood's statement introduces certain important qualifications
into the above account:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Our centre began to engage at the same time as the van, at four,
but at a most <i>improper</i> distance, and our rear, being barely within
random shot, did not fire while the signal for the line was flying.
The <i>London</i> had the signal for close action flying, as well as the signal
for the line ahead at <i>half a cable</i> was under her topsails, with the
main topsail to the mast,<a id="footnotetag99" name="footnotetag99"></a><a href="#footnote99"><sup>99</sup></a> though the enemy's ships were pushing on."
</p></blockquote>

<p>As showing the improper distance at which the <i>London</i>
brought-to to fire, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The second ship astern of her (of the <i>London</i>) received but
trifling damage, and the third astern of her received no damage at
all, which most clearly proves [at] how much too great a distance was
the centre division engaged."
</p></blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span>

<p>The day after the action Hood made a memorandum of
his criticisms upon it, which has been published. The gist
of this is as follows. As the French stood out, their line was
not regular or connected. The van was much separated
from the centre and rear, and it appears also, from the
French narratives, that it was to windward of the rest of the
fleet. From these causes it was much exposed to be attacked
unsupported. There was, by Hood's estimate, "a full hour
and a half to have engaged it before any of the rear could
have come up." The line of battle on the port tack, with
the then wind, was east and west, and Graves had first
ranged his fleet on it, as the French were doing; but afterwards,
owing to his method of approach, by the van bearing
down and the other ships following in its wake, the two lines,
instead of being parallel, formed an angle, the British centre
and rear being much more distant from the enemy than the
van was. This alone would cause the ships to come into
battle successively instead of together, a fault of itself;
but the Commander-in-Chief, according to Hood, committed
the further mistake that he kept the signal for the
line of battle flying until 5.30 P.M., near to sunset. In Hood's
understanding, while that signal flew the position of each ship
was determined by that of Graves's flagship. None could go
closer than the line through her parallel to the enemy.
Hence Hood's criticism, which is marked by much acerbity
towards his superior, but does not betray any consciousness
that he himself needed any justification for his division not having taken part.</p>

<p>"Had the centre gone to the support of the van, <i>and the signal
for the line been hauled down</i>, or the Commander-in-Chief had set the
example of close action, <i>even with the signal for the line flying</i>, the
van
of the enemy must have been cut to pieces, and the rear division
of the British fleet would have been opposed to those ships the centre
division fired at, and at the proper distance for engaging, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span>
Rear-Admiral who commanded it<a id="footnotetag100" name="footnotetag100"></a><a href="#footnote100"><sup>100</sup></a> would have a great deal to answer for."<a id="footnotetag101" name="footnotetag101"></a><a href="#footnote101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

<p>So much for the tactical failure of that day. The question
remained what next was to be done. Graves contemplated
renewing the action, but early in the night was informed
that several of the van ships were too crippled to
permit this. He held his ground, however, in sight of the
French, until dark on the 9th, when they were seen for the
last time. They were then under a cloud of sail, and on the
morning of the 10th had disappeared. From their actions
during this interval, Hood had inferred that de Grasse meant
to get back into the Chesapeake without further fighting;
and he implies that he advised Graves to anticipate the enemy
in so doing. Though some ships were crippled aloft, the
British batteries were practically intact, nor had men enough
been disabled to prevent any gun in the fleet from being
fought. Could but a single working day be gained in taking
up an anchorage, a defensive order could be assumed, practically
impregnable to the enemy, covering Cornwallis, and
not impossibly intercepting the French ships left in the Bay.
In the case of many men such comment might be dismissed
as the idle talk of the captious fault-finder, always to the fore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span>
in life; but in the case of Hood it must be received with
deference, for, but a few months later, when confronted
with greater odds, he himself did the very thing he here
recommended, for an object less vital than the relief of Cornwallis.
Having regard to the character of de Grasse, it
is reasonable to believe that, if he had found the British fleet
thus drawn up at anchor in Chesapeake Bay, as he found
Hood at St. Kitts in the following January, he would have
waited off the entrance for de Barras, and then have gone to
sea, leaving Washington and Rochambeau to look at Cornwallis
slipping out of their grasp.</p>

<p>On the 10th of September Graves decided to burn the
<i>Terrible</i>, 74, which had been, kept afloat with difficulty since
the action. This done, the fleet stood towards the Chesapeake,
a frigate going ahead to reconnoitre. On the 13th,
at 6 A.M., Graves wrote to Hood that the look-outs reported
the French at anchor above the Horse Shoe (shoal) in the
Chesapeake, and desired his opinion what to do with the
fleet. To this Hood sent the comforting reply that it was no
more than what he had expected, as the press of sail the
(French) fleet carried on the 9th, and on the night of the 8th,
made it very clear to him what de Grasse's intentions were.
He "would be very glad to send an opinion, but he really
knows not what to say in the truly lamentable state [to which]
we have brought ourselves."<a id="footnotetag102" name="footnotetag102"></a><a href="#footnote102"><sup>102</sup></a> On the 10th de Barras had
reached the Bay, where he was joined by de Grasse on the 11th,
so that there were then present thirty-six French ships of
the line. Graves, therefore, returned to New York, reaching
Sandy Hook September 19th. On the 14th Washington
had arrived before Yorktown, where he took the chief command; and the armies
closed in upon Cornwallis by land
as the French fleets had done already by water. On the
19th of October the British force was compelled to surrender,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span>
seven thousand two hundred and forty-seven troops and
eight hundred and forty seamen laying down their arms.
During the siege the latter had served in the works, the batteries
of which were largely composed of ships' guns.</p>

<p>After Graves's return to New York, Rear-Admiral the Hon.
Robert Digby arrived from England on the 24th of September,
to take command of the station in Arbuthnot's place.
He brought with him three ships of the line; and the two
which Sir Peter Parker had been ordered by Rodney to send
on at once had also reached the port. It was decided by the
land and sea officers concerned to attempt the relief of
Cornwallis, and that it was expedient for Graves to remain
in command until after this expedition. He could not start,
however, until the 18th of October, by which time Cornwallis's
fate was decided. Graves then departed for
Jamaica to supersede Sir Peter Parker. On the 11th of
November Hood sailed from Sandy Hook with eighteen ships
of the line, and on the 5th of December anchored at
Barbados. On the 5th of November de Grasse also quitted
the continent with his whole fleet, and returned to the West Indies.</p>

that the signal for the line was rehoisted at 6.30. (White: "Naval

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>NAVAL EVENTS OF 1781 IN EUROPE. DARBY'S
RELIEF OF GIBRALTAR, AND THE BATTLE OF THE DOGGER BANK</h3>


<p>In Europe, during the year 1781, the two leading
questions which dominated the action of the belligerents
were the protection, or destruction, of commerce,
and the attack and defence of Gibraltar.
The British Channel Fleet was much inferior to the
aggregate sea forces of France and Spain in the waters
of Europe; and the Dutch navy also was now hostile. The
French government represented to its allies that by concentrating
their squadrons near the entrance of the Channel
they would control the situation in every point of view;
but the Spaniards, intent upon Gibraltar, declined to withdraw
their fleet from Cadiz until late in the summer, while
the French persisted in keeping their own at Brest. The
Channel Fleet was decisively superior to the latter, and inferior
to the Spaniards in numbers only.</p>

<p>No relief having been given Gibraltar since Rodney had
left it in February, 1780, the question of supplying the fortress
became pressing. For this purpose, twenty-eight ships
of the line, under Vice-Admiral George Darby, sailed from
St. Helen's on the 13th of March, 1781, with a large convoy.
Off Cork a number of victuallers joined, and the whole
body then proceeded for Gibraltar, accompanied by five
ships of the line which were destined for the East Indies, as
well as by the West India and American "trade." These
several attachments parted from time to time on the way, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span>
on the 11th of April the main expedition sighted Cape Spartel,
on the African coast. No attempt to intercept it was made
by the great Spanish fleet in Cadiz; and on the 12th of April,
at noon, the convoy anchored in the Bay of Gibraltar. That
night thirteen sail of the transports, under charge of two
frigates, slipped out and made their way to Minorca, then a
British possession. The British ships of war continued under
way, cruising in the Bay and Gut of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>As the convoy entered, the besiegers opened a tremendous
cannonade, which was ineffectual, however, to stop the landing
of the stores. More annoyance was caused by a flotilla
of gunboats, specially built for this siege, the peculiar fighting
power of which lay in one 26-pounder, whose great length
gave a range superior to the batteries of ships of the line.
Being moved by oars as well as by sails, these little vessels
could choose their distance in light airs and calms, and were
used so actively to harass the transports at anchor that
Darby was obliged to cover them with three ships of the line.
These proved powerless effectually to injure the gunboats;
but, while the latter caused great annoyance and petty injury,
they did not hinder the unlading nor even greatly delay it.
The experience illustrates again the unlikelihood that great
results can be obtained by petty means, or that massed force,
force concentrated, can be effectually counteracted either
by cheap and ingenious expedients, or by the co&#246;perative
exertions of many small independent units. "They were
only capable of producing trouble and vexation. So far were
they from preventing the succours from being thrown into
the garrison, or from burning the convoy, that the only
damage of any consequence that they did to the shipping was
the wounding of the mizzen-mast of the <i>Nonsuch</i> so much
that it required to be shifted."<a id="footnotetag103" name="footnotetag103"></a><a href="#footnote103"><sup>103</sup></a> On the 19th of April&mdash;in
one week&mdash;the revictualling was completed, and the expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span>
started back for England. The fleet anchored again
at Spithead on the 22d of May.</p>

<p>While Darby was returning, La Motte Picquet had gone
to sea from Brest with six ships of the line and some frigates
to cruise in the approaches to the Channel. There, on the
2d of May, he fell in with the convoy returning from the
West Indies with the spoils of St. Eustatius. The ships of
war for the most part escaped, but La Motte Picquet carried
twenty-two out of thirty merchant ships into Brest before
he could be intercepted, although a detachment of eight
sail sent by Darby got close upon his heels.</p>

<p>After a long refit, Darby put to sea again, about the 1st of
August, to cover the approach of the large convoys then expected
to arrive. Being greatly delayed by head winds, he
had got no further than the Lizard, when news was brought
him that the Franco-Spanish grand fleet, of forty-nine ships
of the line, was cruising near the Scilly Isles. Having himself
but thirty of the line, he put into Tor Bay on the 24th
of August, and moored his squadron across the entrance to the Bay.</p>

<p>This appearance of the allies was a surprise to the British
authorities, who saw thus unexpectedly renewed the invasion
of the Channel made in 1779. Spain, mortified justly by
her failure even to molest the intrusion of succours into Gibraltar,
had thought to retrieve her honour by an attack upon
Minorca, for which she asked the co&#246;peration of France. De
Guichen was sent in July with nineteen ships of the line; and
the combined fleets, under the chief command of the Spanish
admiral, Don Luis de Cordova, convoyed the troops into the
Mediterranean beyond the reach of Gibraltar cruisers.
Returning thence into the Atlantic, de Cordova directed
his course for the Channel, keeping far out to sea to conceal
his movements. But though thus successful in reaching
his ground unheralded, he made no attempt to profit by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span>
the advantage gained. The question of attacking Darby
at his anchors was discussed in a council of war, at which de
Guichen strongly advocated the measure; but a majority of
votes decided that Great Britain would be less hurt by ruining
her fleet than by intercepting the expected convoys. Even
for the latter purpose, however, de Cordova could not wait.
On the 5th of September he informed de Guichen that he was
at liberty to return to Brest; and he himself went back to
Cadiz with thirty-nine ships, nine of which were French.
"This cruise of the combined fleet," says Chevalier, "diminished
the consideration of France and Spain. These two
powers had made a great display of force, without producing
the slightest result." It may be mentioned here that Minorca,
after a six months' siege, capitulated in February, 1782.</p>

<p>While Darby was beating down Channel in the early days
of August, 1781, Vice-Admiral Hyde Parker, lately Rodney's
second in command in the West Indies, was returning to
England convoying a large merchant fleet from the Baltic.
On the 5th of August, at daylight, a Dutch squadron, also
with a convoy, but outward bound, from the Texel to the
Baltic, was discovered in the south-west, near the Doggersbank.
Heading as the two enemies then were, their courses
must shortly intersect. Parker, therefore, ordered his convoy
to steer to the westward for England, while he himself
bore down for the enemy. The Dutch Rear-Admiral, Johan
Arnold Zoutman, on the contrary, kept the merchant vessels
with him, under his lee, but drew out the ships of war from
among them, to form his order on the side towards the enemy.
Each opponent put seven sail into the line. The British
vessels, besides being of different rates, were chiefly very
old ships, dragged out from Rotten Row to meet the pressing
emergency caused by the greatly superior forces which were
in coalition against Great Britain. Owing to the decayed
condition of some of them, their batteries had been lightened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span>
to the detriment of their fighting power. Two of them, however,
were good and new seventy-fours. It is probable
that the Dutch vessels, after a long peace, were not much
better than their antagonists. In fact, each squadron
was a scratch lot, in the worst sense of the phrase. The
conduct of the affair by the two admirals, even to the very
intensity of their pugnaciousness, contributes a tinge of
the comic to the history of a desperately fought action.
The breeze was fresh at north-east, and the sea smooth.
The Dutch, being to leeward, awaited attack, forming line
on the port tack, heading south-east by east, a point off the
wind, under topsails and foresails, a cable's length apart.
There is little room to doubt that an adversary who thus holds
his ground means to make a stand-up fight, but Parker,
although the sun of a midsummer day had scarcely risen,
thought advisable to order a general chase. Of course, no
ship spared her canvas to this, while the worse sailers had
to set their studdingsails to keep up; and the handling of
the sails took the men off from the preparations for battle.
Parker, who doubtless was still sore over Rodney's censure
of the year before, and who moreover had incurred the Admiralty's
rebuke, for apparent hesitation to attack the
enemy's islands while temporarily in command in the West
Indies, was determined now to show the fight that was in
him. "It is related that, upon being informed of the force of
the Dutch squadron in the morning, he replied (pulling up
his breeches), 'It matters little what their force is; we must
fight them if they are double the number.'" At 6.10 A.M.
the signal was made for line abreast, the ships running down
nearly before the wind. This of course introduced more
regularity, the leading ships taking in their lighter sails to
permit the others to reach their places; but the pace still
was rapid. At 6.45 the order was closed to one cable, and
at 7.56 the signal for battle was hoisted. It is said that at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span>
that moment the 80-gun ship was still securing a studding-sail-boom,
which indicates how closely action trod on the heels of preparation.</p>

<p>The Dutch admiral was as deliberate as Parker was headlong.
An English witness writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"They appeared to be in great order; and their hammocks, quarter-cloths,
etc., were spread in as nice order as if for show in harbour.
Their marines also were well drawn up, and stood with their muskets
shouldered, with all the regularity and exactness of a review. Their
politeness ought to be remembered by every man in our line; for,
as if certain of what happened, we came down almost end-on upon
their broadsides; yet did not the Dutch admiral fire a gun, or make
the signal to engage, till the red flag was at the <i>Fortitude's</i> masthead,
and her shot finding their way into his ship. This was a man&oelig;uvre
which Admiral Zutman should not be warmly thanked for by their
High Mightinesses; as he had it in his power to have done infinite
mischief to our fleet, coming down in that unofficer-like manner.
Having suffered Admiral Parker to place himself as he pleased, he
calmly waited till the signal was hoisted on board the <i>Fortitude</i>, and
at the same time we saw the signal going up on board Admiral
Zutman's ship."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The British, thus unmolested, rounded-to just to windward
of the enemy. A pilot who was on board their leading ship
was for some reason told to assist in laying her close to her
opponent. "By close," he asked, "do you mean about a
ship's breadth?" "Not a gun was fired on either side,"
says the official British report, "until within the distance
of half musket-shot." Parker, whom an on-looker describes
as full of life and spirits, here made a mistake, of a routine
character, which somewhat dislocated his order. It was a
matter of tradition for flagship to seek flagship, just as it was
to signal a general chase, and to bear down together, each
ship for its opposite, well extended with the enemy. Now
Parker, as was usual, was in the centre of his line, the fourth
ship; but Zoutman was for some reason in the fifth. Parker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span>
therefore placed his fourth by the enemy's fifth. In consequence,
the rear British ship overlapped the enemy, and for
a time had no opponent; while the second and third found
themselves engaged with three of the Dutch. At 8 A.M. the
signal for the line was hauled down, and that for close action
hoisted,&mdash;thus avoiding a mistake often made.</p>

<p>All the vessels were soon satisfactorily and hotly at work,
and the action continued with varying phases till 11.35 A.M.
The leading two ships in both orders got well to leeward of
the lines, the British two having to tack to regain their places
to windward. Towards the middle of the engagement
the Dutch convoy bore away, back to the Texel, as the
British had steered for England before it began; the difference
being that the voyage was abandoned by the Dutch and
completed by the British. At eleven o'clock Parker made
sail, and passed with the flagship between the enemy and the
<i>Buffalo</i>, his next ahead and third in the British order; the
three rear ships following close in his wake, in obedience to
the signal for line ahead, which had been rehoisted at 10.43.<a id="footnotetag104" name="footnotetag104"></a><a href="#footnote104"><sup>104</sup></a>
A heavy cannonade attended this evolution, the Dutch
fighting gloriously to the last. When it was completed, the
British fleet wore and the action ceased. "I made an
effort to form the line, in order to renew the action," wrote
Parker in his report, "but found it impracticable. The
enemy appeared to be in as bad a condition. Both squadrons
lay-to a considerable time near each other, when the Dutch,
with their convoy, bore away for the Texel. We were not in
a condition to follow them."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span>

<p>This was a most satisfactory exhibition of valour, and a
most unsatisfactory battle; magnificent, but not war. The
completion of their voyage by the British merchant ships,
while the Dutch were obliged to return to the port which
they had just left, may be considered to award success, and
therefore the essentials of victory, to Parker's fleet. With this
exception the <i>status quo</i> remained much as before, although
one of the Dutch ships sank next day; yet the British loss,
104 killed and 339 wounded, was nearly as great as in Keppel's
action, where thirty ships fought on each side, or in
Rodney's of April 17th, 1780, where the British had twenty
sail; greater than with Graves off the Chesapeake, and, in
proportion, fully equal to the sanguinary conflicts between
Suffren and Hughes in the East Indies. The Dutch loss is
reported as 142 killed, 403 wounded. Both sides aimed at
the hull, as is shown by the injuries; for though much harm
was done aloft, few spars were wholly shot away. The
<i>Buffalo</i>, a small ship, had 39 shot through and through her,
and a very great number pierced between wind and water;
in the British van ship as many as 14, another proof that the Dutch fired low.</p>

<p>With the rudimentary notions of man&oelig;uvring evinced, it
is not surprising that Parker was found an unsatisfactory
second by an enlightened tactician like Rodney. The Vice-Admiral,
however, laid his unsuccess to the indifferent quality
of his ships. George III visited the squadron after the
action, but Parker was not open to compliments. "I wish
your Majesty better ships and younger officers," he said.
"For myself, I am now too old for service." No rewards
were given, and it is asserted that Parker made no secret
that none would be accepted, if offered, at the hands of the
then Admiralty. He voiced the protest of the Navy and of
the nation against the mal-administration of the peace days,
which had left the country unprepared for war. The gallant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span>
veteran was ordered soon afterwards to command in the
East Indies. He sailed for his station in the <i>Cato</i>, which
was never heard of again.</p>

<p>Though unfruitful in substantial results, Parker's action
merits commemoration; for, after all, even where skill does
its utmost, staunchness such as his shows the sound constitution
of a military body.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE FINAL NAVAL CAMPAIGN IN THE WEST INDIES. HOOD AND DE GRASSE. RODNEY
AND DE GRASSE. THE GREAT BATTLE OF APRIL 12, 1782</h3>


<p>The year 1781 closed with an incident more decisive
in character than most of the events that
occurred in European waters during its course;
one also which transfers the interest, by natural
transition, again to the West Indies. The French government
had felt throughout the summer the necessity of sending
de Grasse reinforcements both of ships and of supplies,
but the transports and material of war needed could not be
collected before December. As the British probably would
attempt to intercept a convoy upon which the next campaign
so much depended, Rear-Admiral de Guichen was ordered
to accompany it clear of the Bay of Biscay, with twelve
ships of the line, and then to go to Cadiz. Five ships of the
line destined to de Grasse, and two going to the East Indies,
raised to nineteen the total force with which de Guichen left
Brest on the 10th of December. On the afternoon of the
12th, the French being then one hundred and fifty miles to
the southward and westward of Ushant, with a south-east
wind, the weather, which had been thick and squally, suddenly
cleared and showed sails to windward. These were
twelve ships of the line, one 50, and some frigates, under Rear-Admiral
Richard Kempenfelt, who had left England on the 2d
of the month, to cruise in wait for this expedition. The French
numbers were amply sufficient to frustrate any attack, but de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span>
Guichen, ordinarily a careful officer, had allowed his ships of
war to be to leeward and ahead of the convoy. The latter
scattered in every direction, as the British swooped down upon
them, but all could not escape; and the French ships of war
remained helpless spectators, while the victims were hauling
down their flags right and left. Night coming on, some prizes
could not be secured, but Kempenfelt carried off fifteen, laden
with military and naval stores of great money value and
greater military importance. A few days later a violent
storm dispersed and shattered the remainder of the French
body. Two ships of the line only, the <i>Triomphant</i>, 84, and
<i>Brave</i>, 74, and five transports, could pursue their way to the
West Indies. The rest went back to Brest. This event
may be considered as opening the naval campaign of 1782 in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Kempenfelt, before returning to England, sent off express
to Hood in the West Indies the fireship <i>Tisiphone</i>, 8, Commander
James Saumarez,<a id="footnotetag105" name="footnotetag105"></a><a href="#footnote105"><sup>105</sup></a>&mdash;afterwards the distinguished
admiral,&mdash;with news of the French approach. Saumarez,
having been first to Barbados, joined Hood on the 31st of
January, 1782, in Basse Terre Roads, on the lee side of St.
Kitts; a position from which Hood had dislodged de Grasse
six days before by a brilliant man&oelig;uvre, resembling that
which he had contemplated<a id="footnotetag106" name="footnotetag106"></a><a href="#footnote106"><sup>106</sup></a> as open to Graves the previous
September at Chesapeake Bay for the relief of Cornwallis.
The campaign for the year 1782 had opened already with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span>
attack upon St. Kitts by the French army and navy; and
the French fleet was even then cruising close at hand to leeward,
between St. Kitts and Nevis.</p>

<p>The original intention of de Grasse and de Bouill&#233; had been
to capture Barbados, the most important of the Eastern
Antilles still remaining to the British; but the heavy trade-winds,
which in those days made a winter passage to windward
so long and dreary a beat, twice drove them back to
port. "The whole French fleet," wrote Hood, "appeared off
Santa Lucia on the 17th of last month, endeavouring to get
to windward, and having carried away many topmasts and
yards in struggling against very squally weather, returned to
Fort Royal Bay on the 23d, and on the 28th came out again
with forty transports, man&oelig;uvring as before." On the 2d
of January it disappeared from Santa Lucia, and, after a short
stay again at Martinique, proceeded on the 5th to St. Kitts,
anchoring in Basse Terre Roads on the 11th. The British
garrison retired to Brimstone Hill, a fortified position at the
north-west of the island, while the inhabitants surrendered
the government to the French, pledging themselves to neutrality.
The adjacent island of Nevis capitulated on the same terms on the 20th.</p>

<p>On the 14th of January, an express sent by General Shirley,
governor of St. Kitts, had informed Hood at Barbados that
a great fleet approaching had been seen from the heights of
Nevis on the 10th. Hood at once put to sea, though short
of bread and flour, which could not be had, and with the material
of his ships in wretched condition. "When the <i>President</i><a id="footnotetag107" name="footnotetag107"></a><a href="#footnote107"><sup>107</sup></a>
joins," he wrote the Admiralty, "I shall be twenty-two
strong, with which I beg you will assure their Lordships I
will seek and give battle to the Count de Grasse, be his
numbers as they may." On the way a ship reached him with
word that the French fleet had invested St. Kitts. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span>
21st he anchored at Antigua for repairs and supplies, indispensable
for keeping the sea in the operations which he contemplated,
the duration of which could not be foreseen.
About a thousand troops also were embarked, which, with the
marines that could be spared from the squadron, would give
a landing force of twenty-four hundred men.</p>

<p>St. Kitts being less than fifty miles from Antigua, Hood
doubtless now got accurate information of the enemy's dispositions,
and could form a definite, well-matured plan.
This seems to have been carefully imparted to all his captains,
as was the practice of Nelson, who was the pupil of Hood, if
of any one. "At 9.15 A.M. the Admiral made the signal for
all flag-officers," says the log of the <i>Canada</i>; "and at 4 P.M.
the Admirals and Commodore made the signals for all captains
of their divisions." At 5 P.M. of the same day,
January 23d, the fleet weighed and stood over for Nevis,
round the southern point of which Basse Terre must be
approached; for, the channel between Nevis and St. Kitts
being impracticable for ships of the line, the two islands
were virtually one, and, their common axis lying north-west
and south-east, the trade-wind is fair only when coming from the south.</p>

<p>Basse Terre, where de Grasse then was, is about fifteen
miles from the south point of Nevis. The roadstead lies
east and west, and the French fleet, then twenty-four of the
line and two fifties, were anchored without attention to order,
three or four deep; the eastern ships so placed that an enemy
coming from the southward could reach them with the prevailing
trade-wind, against which the western ships could not
beat up quickly to their support. This being so, we are told
that Hood, starting shortly before sunset with a fair, and
probably fresh wind, from a point only sixty miles distant,
hoped to come upon the French by surprise at early daybreak,
to attack the weather ships, and from them to sail along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span>
hostile order so far as might seem expedient. His column,
thus passing in its entirety close to a certain exposed fraction
of the enemy, the latter would be cut up in detail by the concentration
upon it. The British then, wearing to the southward,
would haul their wind, tack, and again stand up to the
assault, if the enemy continued to await it.</p>

<p>This reasonable expectation, and skilful conception, was
thwarted by a collision, during the night, between a frigate,
the <i>Nymphe</i>, 36, and the leading ship of the line, the <i>Alfred</i>,
74. The repairs to the latter delayed the fleet, the approach
of which was discovered by daylight. De Grasse therefore
put to sea. He imagined Hood's purpose was to throw succours
into Brimstone Hill; and moreover the position of the
enemy now was between him and four ships of the line
momentarily expected from Martinique, one of which joined
him on the same day. The French were all under way by
sunset, standing to the southward under easy sail, towards
the British, who had rounded the south point of Nevis at
1 P.M. Towards dark, Hood went about and stood also to
the southward, seemingly in retreat.</p>

<p>During the following night the British tacked several times,
to keep their position to windward. At daylight of January
25th, the two fleets were to the westward of Nevis; the British
near the island, the French abreast, but several miles to
leeward. Foiled in his first spring by an unexpected accident,
Hood had not relinquished his enterprise, and now proposed
to seize the anchorage quitted by the French, so establishing
himself there,&mdash;as he had proposed to Graves to do
in the Chesapeake,&mdash;that he could not be dislodged. For
such a defensive position St. Kitts offered special advantages.
The anchorage was a narrow ledge, dropping precipitately
to very deep water; and it was possible so to place the ships
that the enemy could not easily anchor near them.</p>

<p>At 5.30 A.M. of the 25th Hood made the signal to form line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span>
of battle on the starboard tack, at one cable interval.<a id="footnotetag108" name="footnotetag108"></a><a href="#footnote108"><sup>108</sup></a> It is
mentioned in the log of the <i>Canada</i>, 74, Captain Cornwallis,
that that ship brought-to in her station, fourth from the rear,
at 7 o'clock. By 10 o'clock the line was formed, and the
ships hove-to in it. At 10.45 the signal was made to fill [to
go ahead], the van ships to carry the same sail as the Admiral,&mdash;topsails
and foresails,&mdash;followed, just before noon,
by the order to prepare to anchor, with springs on the
cables. The French, who were steering south, on the port
tack, while the British were hove-to, went about as soon as
the latter filled, and stood towards them in bow and quarter line.<a id="footnotetag109" name="footnotetag109"></a><a href="#footnote109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/201.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/201.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Hood and De Grasse, January 25, 1782, Figures 1 and 2</div>

<p>At noon the British fleet was running along close under the
high land of Nevis; so close that the <i>Solebay</i>, 28, one of the
frigates inshore of the line, grounded and was wrecked. No
signals were needed, except to correct irregularities in the
order, for the captains knew what they were to do. The
French were approaching steadily, but inevitably dropping
astern with reference to the point of the enemy's line for
which they were heading. At 2 P.M. de Grasse's flagship, the
<i>Ville de Paris</i>, fired several shot at the British rear, which
alone she could reach, while his left wing was nearing the
<i>Barfleur</i>, Hood's flagship, and the vessels astern of her, the
centre of the column, which opened their fire at 2.30. Hood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span>
trusting to his captains, disregarded this threat to the rear
half of his force. Signals flew for the van to crowd sail and
take its anchorage, and at 3.30 P.M. the leading ships began to
anchor in line ahead, (Fig. 1, a), covered as they did so by the
broadsides of the rear and the rear centre (b). Upon the
latter the French were now keeping up a smart fire. Between
the <i>Canada</i> and her next astern, the <i>Prudent</i>, 64,&mdash;which
was a dull sailer,&mdash;there was a considerable interval.
Towards it the French admiral pressed, aiming to cut off the
three rear vessels; but Cornwallis threw everything aback
and closed down upon his consort,&mdash;a stirring deed in which
he was imitated by the <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Bedford</i>, 74's, immediately
ahead of him. De Grasse was thus foiled, but so
narrowly, that an officer, looking from one of the ships which
had anchored, asserted that for a moment he could perceive
the <i>Ville de Paris's</i> jib inside the British line. As the rear
of the latter pushed on to its place, it cleared the broadsides
of the now anchored van and centre, (Fig. 2, a), and these
opened upon the enemy, a great part of whom were strung out
behind the British column, without opponents as yet, but
hastening up to get their share of the action. Hood's flagship,
(f), which anchored at 4.03, opened fire again at 4.40 P.M.
Thus, as the <i>Canada</i> and her few companions, who bore the
brunt of the day, were shortening sail and rounding-to, (b), still
under a hot cannonade, the batteries of their predecessors were
ringing out their welcome, and at the same time covering
their movements by giving the enemy much else to think
about. The <i>Canada</i>, fetching up near the tail of the
column and letting go in a hurry, ran out two cables on end,
and found upon sounding that she had dropped her anchor
in a hundred and fifty fathoms of water. The French column
stood on, off soundings, though close to, firing as it
passed, and then, wearing to the southward in succession,
stood out of action on the port tack, (c), its ineffectual broadsides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span>
adding to the grandeur and excitement of the scene, and
swelling the glory of Hood's successful daring, of which it is
difficult to speak too highly. Lord Robert Manners, the
captain of the <i>Resolution</i>, which was fifth ship from the
British rear, writing a week later, passed upon this achievement
a verdict, which posterity will confirm. "The taking
possession of this road was well judged, well conducted, and
well executed, though indeed the French had an opportunity&mdash;which
they missed&mdash;of bringing our rear to a very severe
account. The van and centre divisions brought to an anchor
under the fire of the rear, which was engaged with the enemy's
centre (Fig. 1); and then the centre, being at an anchor and
properly placed, covered us while we anchored (Fig. 2),
making, I think, the most masterly man&oelig;uvre I ever saw."
Whether regard be had to the thoughtful preparation, the
crafty management of the fleet antecedent to the final push,
the calculated audacity of the latter, or the firm and sagacious
tactical handling from the first moment to the last, Nelson
himself never did a more brilliant deed than this of Hood's.<a id="footnotetag110" name="footnotetag110"></a><a href="#footnote110"><sup>110</sup></a>
All firing ceased at 5.30.</p>

<p>Naturally, an order taken up under such conditions needed
some rectifying before further battle. As the proper stationing
of the fleet depended in great measure upon the position
of the van ship, Hood had put a local pilot on board her;
but when the action ceased, he found that she was not as
close to the shore as he had intended. The rear, on the other
hand, was naturally in the most disorder, owing to the
circumstances attending its anchorage. Three ships from the
rear were consequently directed to place themselves ahead
of the van, closing the interval, while others shifted their
berths, according to specific directions. The order as finally
assumed (Fig. 3) was as follows. The van ship was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span>
anchored so close to the shore that it was impossible to pass
within her, or, with the prevailing wind, even to reach her,
because of a point and shoal just outside, covering her position.
From her the line extended in a west-north-west direction
to the fifteenth ship,&mdash;the <i>Barfleur</i>, 98, Hood's flagship,&mdash;when
it turned to north, the last six ships being on a
north and south line. These six, with their broadsides turned
to the westward, prevented a column passing from south to
north, the only way one could pass, from enfilading the main
line with impunity. The latter covered with its guns the
approach from the south. All the ships had springs on their
cables, enabling them to turn their sides so as to cover a large
arc of a circle with their batteries.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/203.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/203.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Hood and De Grasse, January 26, 1782, Figure 3</div>

<p>At daylight on the following morning, January 26th, the
ships began changing their places, the French being then
seven or eight miles distant in the south-south-east. At
7 A.M. they were seen to be approaching in line of battle,
under a press of sail, heading for the British van. The
<i>Canada</i>, which had begun at 5 A.M. to tackle her 200-odd
fathoms of cable, was obliged to cut, whereby "we lost the
small bower anchor and two cables with one 8-inch and one
9-inch hawsers, which were bent for springs." The ship
had to work to windward to close with the fleet, and was
therefore ordered by the Rear-Admiral to keep engaging
under way, until 10.50, when a message was sent her to anchor
in support of the rear. The action began between 8.30 and
9 A.M., the leading French ship heading for the British van,
seemingly with the view of passing round and inside it.
Against this attempt Hood's precautions probably were sufficient;
but as the enemy's vessel approached, the wind
headed her, so that she could only fetch the third ship. The
latter, with the vessels ahead and astern, sprung their batteries
upon her. "The crash occasioned by their destructive
broadsides was so tremendous on board her that whole pieces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span>
of plank were seen flying from her off side, ere she could escape
the cool concentrated fire of her determined adversaries."<a id="footnotetag111" name="footnotetag111"></a><a href="#footnote111"><sup>111</sup></a>
She put her helm up, and ran along outside the
British line, receiving the first fire of each successive ship.
Her movement was imitated by her followers, some keeping
off sooner, some later; but de Grasse in his flagship not only
came close, but pointed his after yards to the wind,<a id="footnotetag112" name="footnotetag112"></a><a href="#footnote112"><sup>112</sup></a> to move
the slower. As he ported his helm when leaving the <i>Barfleur</i>,
this brought these sails aback, keeping him a still longer time
before the British ships thrown to the rear. "In this he
was supported by those ships which were astern, or immediately
ahead of him. During this short but tremendous
conflict in that part of the field of battle, nothing whatever
could be seen of them for upwards of twenty minutes, save
de Grasse's white flag at the main-topgallant masthead of the
<i>Ville de Paris</i>, gracefully floating above the immense volumes
of smoke that enveloped them, or the pennants of those
ships which were occasionally perceptible, when an increase
of breeze would waft away the smoke."<a id="footnotetag113" name="footnotetag113"></a><a href="#footnote113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

<p>Though most gallantly done, no such routine man&oelig;uvre as
this could shake Hood's solidly assumed position. The
attempt was repeated in the afternoon, but more feebly, and
upon the centre and rear only. This also was ineffectual;
and Hood was left in triumphant possession of the field.
The losses in the several affairs of the two days had been:
British, 72 killed, 244 wounded; French, 107 killed, 207
wounded. Thenceforth the French fleet continued cruising
to leeward of the island, approaching almost daily, frequently
threatening attack, and occasionally exchanging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span>
distant shots; but no serious encounter took place. Interest
was centred on Brimstone Hill, where alone on the island
the British flag still flew. De Grasse awaited its surrender,
flattering himself that the British would be forced then to
put to sea, and that his fleet, increased by successive arrivals
to thirty-two of the line, would then find an opportunity
to crush the man who had outwitted and out-man&oelig;uvred him
on January 25th and 26th. In this hope he was deceived by
his own inaptness and his adversary's readiness. Hood was
unable to succour Brimstone Hill, for want of troops; the
French having landed six thousand men, against which the
British twenty-four hundred could effect nothing, either
alone or in co&#246;peration with the garrison, which was but
twelve hundred strong. The work capitulated on the 13th
of February. De Grasse, who had neglected to keep his
ships provisioned, went next day to Nevis and anchored
there to empty the storeships. That evening Hood called
his captains on board, explained his intentions, had them
set their watches by his, and at 11 P.M. the cables were cut
one by one, lights being left on the buoys, and the fleet silently
decamped, passing round the north end of St. Kitts,
and so towards Antigua. When de Grasse opened his eyes
next morning, the British were no longer to be seen. "Nothing
could have been more fortunately executed," wrote
Lord Robert Manners, "as not one accident happened from
it. Taking the whole in one light, though not successful in
the point we aimed at, nevertheless it was well conducted,
and has given the enemy a pretty severe check; and if you
give him half the credit the enemy does, Sir Samuel Hood
will stand very high in the public estimation."</p>

<p>Hood's intention had been to return to Barbados; but
on the 25th of February he was joined, to windward of
Antigua, by Rodney, who had arrived from England a
week earlier, bringing with him twelve ships of the line.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span>
The new Commander-in-Chief endeavoured to cut off de
Grasse from Martinique, but the French fleet got in there on
the 26th. Rodney consequently went to Santa Lucia, to
refit Hood's ships, and to prepare for the coming campaign,
in which it was understood that the conquest of Jamaica was
to be the first object of the allies. An important condition
to their success was the arrival of a great convoy, known to
be on its way from Brest to repair the losses which Kempenfelt's
raid and subsequent bad weather had inflicted in December.
Hood suggested to Rodney to halve the fleet,
which then numbered thirty-six of the line, letting one part
cruise north of Dominica, between that island and Deseada,
while the other guarded the southern approach, between
Martinique and Santa Lucia. Rodney, however, was unwilling
to do this, and adopted a half-measure,&mdash;Hood's division
being stationed to windward of the north end of Martinique,
reaching only as far north as the latitude of Dominica,
while the center and rear were abreast of the centre and south
of Martinique; all in mutual touch by intermediate vessels.
It would seem&mdash;reading between the lines&mdash;that Hood
tried to stretch his cruising ground northwards, in pursuance
of his own ideas, but Rodney recalled him. The
French convoy consequently passed north of Deseada, convoyed
by two ships of the line, and on the 20th of March
reached Martinique safely. De Grasse's force was thus raised
to thirty-five of the line, including two 50-gun ships, as
against the British thirty-six. At the end of the month
Rodney returned to Santa Lucia, and there remained at
anchor, vigilantly watching the French fleet in Fort Royal
by means of a chain of frigates.</p>

<p>The problem now immediately confronting de Grasse&mdash;the
first step towards the conquest of Jamaica&mdash;was extremely
difficult. It was to convoy to Cap Fran&#231;ois the
supply vessels essential to his enterprise, besides the merchant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span>
fleet bound for France; making in all one hundred
and fifty unarmed ships to be protected by his thirty-five
sail of the line, in face of the British thirty-six. The trade-wind
being fair, he purposed to skirt the inner northern edge
of the Caribbean Sea; by which means he would keep close
to a succession of friendly ports, wherein the convoy might
find refuge in case of need.</p>

<p>With this plan the French armament put to sea on the
8th of April, 1782. The fact being reported promptly to
Rodney, by noon his whole fleet was clear of its anchorage
and in pursuit. Then was evident the vital importance of
Barrington's conquest of Santa Lucia; for, had the British
been at Barbados, the most probable alternative, the French
movement not only would have been longer unknown, but
pursuit would have started from a hundred miles distant,
instead of thirty. If the British had met this disadvantage
by cruising before Martinique, they would have encountered
the difficulty of keeping their ships supplied
with water and other necessaries, which Santa Lucia afforded.
In truth, without in any degree minimizing the faults of the
loser, or the merits of the winner, in the exciting week that
followed, the opening situation may be said to have represented
on either side an accumulation of neglects or of successes,
which at the moment of their occurrence may have
seemed individually trivial; a conspicuous warning against
the risk incurred by losing single points in the game
of war. De Grasse was tremendously handicapped from
the outset by the errors of his predecessors and of himself.
That the British had Santa Lucia as their outpost was due
not only to Barrington's diligence, but also to d'Estaing's
slackness and professional timidity; and it may be
questioned whether de Grasse himself had shown a proper
understanding of strategic conditions, when he neglected
that island in favour of Tobago and St. Kitts. Certainly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg 208]</span>
Hood had feared for it greatly the year before. That
the convoy was there to embarrass his movements, may not
have been the fault of the French admiral; but it was greatly
and entirely his fault that, of the thirty-six ships pursuing
him, twenty-one represented a force that he might have
crushed in detail a few weeks before,&mdash;not to mention the
similar failure of April, 1781.<a id="footnotetag114" name="footnotetag114"></a><a href="#footnote114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>

<p>Large bodies of ships commonly will move less rapidly than
small. By 2.30 P.M. of the day of starting, Rodney's look-outs
had sighted the French fleet; and before sundown it
could be seen from the mastheads of the main body. At
6 next morning, April 9th, the enemy, both fleet and convoy,
was visible from the deck of the <i>Barfleur</i>, the flagship of
Hood's division, then in the British van. The French bore
north-east, distant four to twelve miles, extending from
abreast of the centre of Dominica northwards towards Guadeloupe.
The British had gained much during the night, and
their centre was now off Dominica to leeward of the enemy's
rear, which was becalmed under the island. Some fourteen
or fifteen of the French van, having opened out the channel
between Dominica and Guadeloupe, felt a fresh trade-wind,
from east by north, with which they steered north; and
their number was gradually increased as individual ships,
utilising the catspaws, stole clear of the high land of
Dominica. Hood's division in like manner, first among the
British, got the breeze, and, with eight ships, the commander of
the van stood north in order of battle. To the north-west of
him were two French vessels, separated from their consorts
and threatened to be cut off (i). These stood boldly down
and crossed the head of Hood's column; one passing so close
to the leading ship, the <i>Alfred</i>, that the latter had to bear up
to let her pass. Rodney had hoisted a signal to engage at
6.38 A.M., but had hauled it down almost immediately, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>
Hood would not fire without orders. These ships therefore
rejoined their main body unharmed. At 8.30 the French
hoisted their colours, and shortly afterwards the vessels which
had cleared Dominica tacked and stood south, opposite to Hood.</p>

<p>De Grasse now had recognised that he could not escape
action, if the convoy kept company. He therefore directed
the two 50-gun ships, <i>Exp&#233;riment</i> and <i>Sagittaire</i>, to accompany
it into Guadeloupe, where it arrived safely that day (Position
1, dd); and he decided that the fleet should ply to windward
through the channel between Dominica and Guadeloupe,
nearly midway in which lies a group of small islands called
Les Saintes,&mdash;a name at times given to the battle of April
12th. By this course he hoped not only to lead the enemy
away from the convoy, but also to throw off pursuit through
his superior speed, and so to accomplish his mission unharmed.
The French ships, larger, deeper, and with better
lines than their opponents, were naturally better sailers,
and it may be inferred that even coppering had not entirely
overcome this original disadvantage of the British.</p>

<p>At the very moment of beginning his new policy, however,
a subtle temptation assailed de Grasse irresistibly, in the
exposed position of Hood's column (h); and he met it, not by
a frank and hearty acceptance of a great opportunity, but
by a half-measure. Hood thoroughly crushed, the British
fleet became hopelessly inferior to the French; Hood damaged,
and it became somewhat inferior: possibly it would
be deterred from further pursuit. De Grasse decided for
this second course, and ordered part of his fleet to attack.
This operation was carried out under the orders of the
Marquis de Vaudreuil, the second in command. The ships
engaged in it bore down from the windward, attacked Hood's
rear ships, stood along northward (f) on the weather side of his
column at long range, and, having passed ahead, tacked (t) in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg 210]</span>
succession and formed again in the rear, (f^2) whence they repeated
the same man&oelig;uvre (Positions 1 and 2). Thus a procession
of fifteen ships kept passing by eight, describing a
continuous curve of elliptical form. They were able to do this
because Hood was condemned to a low speed, lest he should
draw too far away from the British centre (a) and rear (c),
still becalmed under Dominica (Position 2). The French,
having choice of distance, kept at long gunshot, because they
were deficient in carronades, of which the British had many.
These guns, of short range but large calibre, were thus rendered
useless. Could they have come into play, the French
rigging and sails would have suffered severely. This first
engagement (Position 1) lasted, by Hood's log, from 9.48 to
10.25 A.M. It was resumed in stronger force (Position 2) at
14 minutes past noon, and continued till 1.45 P.M., when firing
ceased for that day; Rodney hauling down the signal for
battle at 2. Between the two affairs, which were identical in
general character, Hood's column was reinforced, and great
part of the British centre also got into action with some
of the French main body, though at long range only.
"Except the two rear ships," wrote Rodney to Hood that
night, "the others fired at such a distance that I returned none."</p>

Figures 1 and 2</div>

<p>The injuries to the British ships engaged were not such as
to compel them to leave the fleet. The <i>Royal Oak</i> lost her
main topmast, and that of the <i>Warrior</i> fell two days later,
not improbably from wounds; but in these was nothing that
the ready hands of seamen could not repair so as to continue
the chase. Rodney, therefore, contented himself with
reversing the order of sailing, putting Hood in the rear,
whereby he was able to refit, and yet follow fast enough
not to be out of supporting distance. This circumstance
caused Hood's division to be in the rear in the battle of the
12th. One of the French ships, the <i>Caton</i>, 64, had been so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span>
injured that de Grasse detached her into Guadeloupe. It
must be remembered that a crippled ship in a chased fleet
not only embarrasses movement, but may compromise the
whole body, if the latter delay to protect it; whereas the
chaser keeps between his lame birds and the enemy.</p>

<p>During the night of the 9th the British lay-to for repairs.
The next morning they resumed the pursuit, turning to
windward after the enemy, but upon the whole losing throughout
the 10th and the 11th. At daylight of the 10th the
French, by the logs of Hood and Cornwallis, were "from four
to five leagues distant," "just in sight from the deck."
During that night, however, the <i>Z&#233;l&#233;</i>, 74, had collided with
the <i>Jason</i>, 64; and the latter was injured so far as to be
compelled to follow the <i>Caton</i> into Guadeloupe. At sunset
of that day Rodney signalled a general chase to windward,
the effect of which was to enable each ship to do her best
according to her captain's judgment during the dark hours.
Nevertheless, on the morning of the 11th the French seem
again to have gained, for Hood, who, it will be remembered,
was now in the rear, notes that at 10 A.M. twenty-two French
sail (not all the fleet) could be counted <i>from the masthead</i>;
Cornwallis, further to windward, could count thirty-three.
Troude, a French authority, says that at that time nearly
all the French had doubled The Saintes, that is, had got
to windward of them, and it looked as though de Grasse
might succeed in throwing off his pursuer. Unluckily,
two ships, the <i>Magnanime</i>, 74, and the <i>Z&#233;l&#233;</i>, 74, the latter
of which had lost her main topmast, were several miles to
leeward of the French main body. It was necessary to delay,
or to drop those vessels. Again, trivial circumstances
conspired to further a great disaster, and de Grasse bore
down to cover the crippled ships; so losing much of his
hard-won ground, and entailing a further misfortune that
night. Rodney hung doggedly on, relying on the chapter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg 212]</span>
of accidents, as one who knows that all things come to him
who endures. To be sure, there was not much else he could
do; yet he deserves credit for unremitting industry and
pluck. During the afternoon, the signals noted in the
British logs&mdash;to call in all cruisers and for the fleet to close&mdash;attest
mutely the movement of de Grasse in bearing down,&mdash;coming nearer.</p>

Rodney and De Grasse, April 9 and 12, 1782<br />
Figure 3</div>

<p>During the night, at 2 A.M. of April 12th, the <i>Z&#233;l&#233;</i> and de
Grasse's flagship, the <i>Ville de Paris</i>, 110, crossing on opposite
tacks, came into collision. The former lost both foremast
and bowsprit. It has been stated by John Paul Jones, who
by permission of Congress embarked a few months later on
board the French fleet as a volunteer, and doubtless thus
heard many personal narratives, that this accident was due
to the deficiency of watch-officers in the French navy; the
deck of the <i>Z&#233;l&#233;</i> being in charge of a young ensign, instead
of an experienced lieutenant. It was necessary to rid the
fleet of the <i>Z&#233;l&#233;</i> at once, or an action could not be avoided;
so a frigate was summoned to tow her, and the two were left
to make their way to Guadeloupe, while the others resumed
the beat to windward. At 5 A.M. she and the frigate were
again under way, steering for Guadeloupe, to the north-west,
making from five to six miles (Position 3, a); but in the
interval they had been nearly motionless, and consequently
when day broke at 5.30 they were only two leagues from the
<i>Barfleur</i>, Hood's flagship, which, still in the British rear, was
then standing south on the port tack. The body of the French,
(Position 3), was at about the same distance as on the previous
evening,&mdash;ten to fifteen miles,&mdash;but the <i>Ville de Paris</i> (c)
not more than eight. Just before 6 A.M. Rodney signalled
Hood, who was nearest, to chase the <i>Z&#233;l&#233;</i>; and four of the
rearmost ships of the line were detached for that purpose (b).
De Grasse, seeing this, signalled his vessels at 6 A.M. to close
the flagship, making all sail; and he himself bore down to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg 213]</span>
the westward (cc'), on the port tack, but running free, to
frighten away Rodney's chasers. The British Admiral kept
them out until 7 o'clock, by which time de Grasse was fairly
committed to his false step. All cruisers were then called
in, and the line was closed to one cable.<a id="footnotetag115" name="footnotetag115"></a><a href="#footnote115"><sup>115</sup></a> Within an hour
were heard the opening guns of the great battle, since known
by the names of the 12th of April, or of The Saintes, and, in
the French navy, of Dominica. The successive losses of
the <i>Caton</i>, <i>Jason</i>, and <i>Z&#233;l&#233;</i>, with the previous detachment
of the two 50-gun ships with the convoy, had reduced the
French numbers from thirty-five to thirty effective vessels.
The thirty-six British remained undiminished.</p>

<p>The British appear to have been standing to the south on
the port tack at daylight; but, soon after sending out the
chasers, Rodney had ordered the line of bearing (from ship
to ship) to be north-north-east to south-south-west, evidently
in preparation for a close-hauled line of battle on the starboard
tack, heading northerly to an east wind. Somewhat
unusually, the wind that morning held at south-east for some
time, enabling the British to lie up as high as east-north-east
on the starboard tack (Position 3, d), on which they were when
the battle joined; and this circumstance, being very favourable
for gaining to windward,&mdash;to the eastward,&mdash;doubtless
led to the annulling of the signal for the line of bearing,
half an hour after it was made, and the substitution for it of
the line of battle ahead at one cable. It is to be inferred that
Rodney's first purpose was to tack together, thus restoring
Hood to the van, his natural station; but the accident of
the wind holding to the southward placed the actual van&mdash;regularly
the rear&mdash;most to windward, and rendered it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span>
expedient to tack in succession, instead of all together,
preserving to the full the opportunity which chance had
extended for reaching the enemy. In the engagement, therefore,
Hood commanded in the rear, and Rear-Admiral Drake
in the van. The wind with the French seems to have been
more to the eastward than with the British,&mdash;not an unusual
circumstance in the neighbourhood of land.</p>

<p>As Rodney, notwithstanding his haste, had formed line
from time to time during the past three days, his fleet was
now in good order, and his signals were chiefly confined to
keeping it closed. The French, on the other hand, were
greatly scattered when their Commander-in-Chief, in an impulse
of hasty, unbalanced judgment, abandoned his previous
cautious policy and hurried them into action. Some of
them were over ten miles to windward of the flagship.
Though they crowded sail to rejoin her, there was not time
enough for all to take their stations properly, between daylight
and 8 A.M., when the firing began. "Our line of battle
was formed under the fire of musketry,"<a id="footnotetag116" name="footnotetag116"></a><a href="#footnote116"><sup>116</sup></a> wrote the Marquis
de Vaudreuil, the second in command, who, being in the
rear of the fleet on this occasion, and consequently among
the last to be engaged, had excellent opportunity for observation.
At the beginning it was in de Grasse's power to
postpone action, until the order should be formed, by holding
his wind under short canvas; while the mere sight of
his vessels hurrying down for action would have compelled
Rodney to call in the ships chasing the <i>Z&#233;l&#233;</i>, the rescue of
which was the sole motive of the French man&oelig;uvre. Instead
of this, the French flagship kept off the wind; which
precipitated the collision, while at the same time delaying
the preparations needed to sustain it. To this de Grasse
added another fault by forming on the port tack, the contrary
to that on which the British were, and standing southerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span>
towards Dominica. The effect of this was to bring
his ships into the calms and baffling winds which cling to
the shore-line, thus depriving them of their power of man&oelig;uvre.
His object probably was to confine the engagement
to a mere pass-by on opposite tacks, by which in all
previous instances the French had thwarted the decisive
action that Rodney sought. Nevertheless, the blunder was
evident at once to French eyes. "What evil genius has inspired
the admiral?" exclaimed du Pavillon, Vaudreuil's
flag-captain, who was esteemed one of the best tacticians
in France, and who fell in the battle.</p>

Rodney and De Grasse, April 9 and 12, 1782<br />
Figures 4 and 5
</div>

<p>As the two lines drew near to one another, standing, the
French south, the British east-north-east, the wind shifted
back to the eastward, allowing the French to head higher,
to south-south-east, and knocking the British off to north-north-east
(Position 4). The head of the French column
thus passed out of gunshot, across the bows of Rodney's
leading vessel, the <i>Marlborough</i>, (m), which came within range
when abreast the eighth ship. The first shots were fired
by the <i>Brave</i>, 74, ninth in the French line, at 8 A.M. The
British captain then put his helm up and ran slowly along,
north-north-west, under the lee of the French, towards their
rear. The rest of the British fleet followed in his wake.
The battle thus assumed the form of passing in opposite directions
on parallel lines; except that the French ships, as
they successively cleared the point where the British column
struck their line, would draw out of fire, their course diverging
thenceforth from that of the British approach. The
effect of this would be that the British rear, when it reached
that point, would be fresh, having undergone no fire, and with
that advantage would encounter the French rear, which had
received already the fire of the British van and centre. To
obviate this, by bringing his own van into action, de Grasse
signalled the van ships to lead south-south-west, parallel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span>
with the British north-north-east (4, a). The engagement
thus became general all along the lines; but it is probable
that the French van was never well formed. Its commander,
at all events, reached his post later than the commander of the rear did his.<a id="footnotetag117" name="footnotetag117"></a><a href="#footnote117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>

<p>At five minutes past eight, Rodney made a general signal
for close action, followed immediately by another for the
leading ships to head one point to starboard&mdash;towards the
enemy&mdash;which indicates that he was not satisfied with the
distance first taken by the <i>Marlborough</i>. The <i>Formidable</i>,
his flagship, eighteenth in the column, began to fire at 8.23;<a id="footnotetag118" name="footnotetag118"></a><a href="#footnote118"><sup>118</sup></a>
but the <i>Barfleur</i>, Hood's flagship, which was thirty-first,
not till 9.25. This difference in time is to be accounted for
chiefly by the light airs near Dominica, contrasted with the
fresh trades in the open channel to the northward, which
the leading British vessels felt before their rear. De Grasse
now, too late, had realised the disastrous effect which this
would have upon his fleet. If he escaped all else, his ships,
baffled by calms and catspaws while the British had a breeze,
must lose the weather-gage, and with it the hope of evading
pursuit, hitherto his chief preoccupation. Twice he signalled
to wear,&mdash;first, all together, then in succession,&mdash;but,
although the signals were seen, they could not be
obeyed with the enemy close under the lee. "The French
fleet," comments Chevalier justly, "had freedom of movement
no longer. A fleet cannot wear with an enemy's fleet
within musket-range to leeward."</p>

<p>The movement therefore continued as described, the opposing
ships slowly "sliding by" each other until about
9.15, when the wind suddenly shifted back to south-east
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg 217]</span>
again. The necessity of keeping the sails full forced the bows
of each French vessel towards the enemy (Position 5),
destroying the order in column, and throwing the fleet into
<i>&#233;chelon</i>, or, as the phrase then was, into bow and quarter line.<a id="footnotetag119" name="footnotetag119"></a><a href="#footnote119"><sup>119</sup></a>
The British, on the contrary, were free either to hold their
course or to head towards the enemy. Rodney's flagship
(5, a) luffed, and led through the French line just astern of
the <i>Glorieux</i>, 74, (g), which was the nineteenth in their order.
She was followed by five ships; and her next ahead also,
the <i>Duke</i> (d), seeing her chief's movement, imitated it, breaking
through the line astern of the twenty-third French. The
<i>Glorieux</i>, on the starboard hand of Rodney's little column,
received its successive broadsides. Her main and mizzen
masts went overboard at 9.28, when the <i>Canada</i>, third astern
of the <i>Formidable</i>, had just passed her; and a few moments
later her foremast and bowsprit fell. At 9.33 the <i>Canada</i> was
to windward of the French line. The flagship <i>Formidable</i>
was using both broadsides as she broke through the enemy's
order. On her port hand, between her and the <i>Duke</i>, were
four French ships huddled together (c), one of which had
paid off the wrong way; that is, after the shift of wind took
her aback, her sails had filled on the opposite tack from that
of the rest of her fleet.<a id="footnotetag120" name="footnotetag120"></a><a href="#footnote120"><sup>120</sup></a> These four, receiving the repeated
broadsides, at close quarters, of the <i>Formidable</i>, <i>Duke</i>, and
<i>Namur</i>, and having undergone besides the fire of the British
van, were very severely mauled. While these things were
happening, the <i>Bedford</i>, the sixth astern of the <i>Formidable</i>,
perhaps unable to see her next ahead in the smoke, had
luffed independently (b), and was followed by the twelve
rearmost British ships, whom she led through the French
order astern of the <i>C&#233;sar</i>, 74, (k), twelfth from the van. This
ship and her next ahead, the <i>Hector</i>, 74, (h), suffered as did the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg 218]</span>
<i>Glorieux</i>. The <i>Barfleur</i>, which was in the centre of this
column of thirteen, opened fire at 9.25. At 10.45 she "ceased
firing, having passed the enemy's van ships;" that is, she was
well on the weather side of the French fleet. Some of the
rearmost of Hood's division, however, were still engaged at
noon; but probably all were then to windward of the enemy.</p>

Figure 6</div>

<p>The British ships ahead of the <i>Duke</i>, the van and part of
the centre, in all sixteen sail, had continued to stand to the
northward. At the time Rodney broke the line, several
of them must have passed beyond the French rear, and out
of action. One, the <i>America</i>, the twelfth from the van, wore
without signals, to pursue the enemy, and her example was
followed at once by the ship next ahead, the <i>Russell</i>, Captain
Saumarez. No signal following, the <i>America</i> again
wore and followed her leaders, but the <i>Russell</i> continued as
she was, now to windward of the French; by which course
she was able to take a conspicuous share in the closing scenes.
At 11.33 Rodney signalled the van to tack, but the delay of
an hour or more had given the <i>Russell</i> a start over the other
ships of her division "towards the enemy" which could not be overcome.</p>

<p>The effect of these several occurrences had been to transfer
the weather-gage, the position for attack, to the British
from the French, and to divide the latter also into three
groups, widely separated and disordered (Position 6). In
the centre was the flagship <i>Ville de Paris</i> with five ships (c).
To windward of her, and two miles distant, was the van, of
some dozen vessels (v). The rear was four miles away to
leeward (r). To restore the order, and to connect the fleet
again, it was decided to re-form on the leewardmost ships;
and several signals to this effect were made by de Grasse.
They received but imperfect execution. The manageable
vessels succeeded easily enough in running before the wind to
leeward, but, when there, exactitude of position and of movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg 219]</span>
was unattainable to ships in various degrees of disability,
with light and baffling side airs. The French were
never again in order after the wind shifted and the line was
broken; but the movement to leeward left the dismasted
<i>Glorieux</i>, (g), <i>Hector</i>, (h), and <i>C&#233;sar</i>, (k), motionless
between the hostile lines.</p>

<p>It has been remarked, disparagingly, that the British fleet
also was divided into three by the man&oelig;uvre of breaking
the line. This is true; but the advantage remained with it
incontestably, in two respects. By favor of the wind, each
of the three groups had been able to maintain its general
formation in line or column, instead of being thrown entirely
out, as the French were; and passing thus in column along
the <i>Glorieux</i>, <i>Hector</i>, and <i>C&#233;sar</i>, they wrought upon these
three ships a concentration of injury which had no parallel
among the British vessels. The French in fact had lost
three ships, as well as the wind. To these certain disadvantages
is probably to be added a demoralisation among
the French crews, from the much heavier losses resultant
upon the British practice of firing at the hull. An officer
present in the action told Sir John Ross<a id="footnotetag121" name="footnotetag121"></a><a href="#footnote121"><sup>121</sup></a> afterwards that
the French fired very high throughout; and he cited in illustration
that the three trucks<a id="footnotetag122" name="footnotetag122"></a><a href="#footnote122"><sup>122</sup></a> of the British <i>Princesa</i> were
shot away. Sir Gilbert Blane, who, though Physician to
the Fleet, obtained permission to be on deck throughout
the action, wrote ten days after it, "I can aver from my own
observation that the French fire slackens as we approach,
and is totally silent when we are close alongside." It is
needless to say that a marked superiority of fire will silence
that of the bravest enemy; and the practice of aiming at
the spars and sails, however suited for frustrating an approach,
substantially conceded that superiority upon which the issue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>
of decisive battle depends. As illustrative of this result,
the British loss will be stated here. It was but 243 killed
and 816 wounded in a fleet of thirty-six sail. The highest
in any one ship was that of the <i>Duke</i>, 73 killed and wounded.
No certain account, or even very probable estimate, of the
French loss has ever been given. None is cited by French
authorities. Sir Gilbert Blane, who was favourably placed
for information, reckoned that of the <i>Ville de Paris</i> alone to
be 300. There being fifty-four hundred troops distributed
among the vessels of the fleet, the casualties would be proportionately
more numerous; but, even allowing for this,
there can be no doubt that the loss of the French, to use Chevalier's
words, "was certainly much more considerable"
than that reported by the British. Six post-captains out
of thirty were killed, against two British out of thirty-six.</p>

<p>Rodney did not make adequate use of the great opportunity,
which accident rather than design had given him at
noon of April 12th. He did allow a certain liberty of man&oelig;uvre,
by discontinuing the order for the line of battle;
but the signal for close action, hoisted at 1 P.M., was hauled
down a half-hour later. Hood, who realised the conditions
plainly visible, as well as the reasonable inferences therefrom,
wished the order given for a general chase, which would
have applied the spur of emulation to every captain present,
without surrendering the hold that particular signals afford
upon indiscreet movements. He bitterly censured the Admiral's
failure to issue this command. Had it been done, he said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I am very confident we should have had twenty sail of the
enemy's ships before dark. Instead of that, he pursued only under
his topsails (sometimes his foresail was set and at others his mizzen
topsail aback) the greatest part of the afternoon, though the <i>flying</i>
enemy had all the sail set their very shattered state would allow."<a id="footnotetag123" name="footnotetag123"></a><a href="#footnote123"><sup>123</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>

<p>To make signal for a general chase was beyond the competence
of a junior admiral; but Hood did what he could,
by repeated signals to individual ships of his own division
to make more sail, by setting all he could on the <i>Barfleur</i>,
and by getting out his boats to tow her head round. Sir
Gilbert Blane unintentionally gives a similar impression of laxity.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"After cutting the French line, the action during the rest of the
day was partial and desultory, the enemy never being able to form,
and several of the [our] ships being obliged to lie by and repair their
damages. As the signal for the line was now hauled down, every
ship annoyed the enemy as their respective commanders judged
best."<a id="footnotetag124" name="footnotetag124"></a><a href="#footnote124"><sup>124</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>For this indolent abandonment of the captains to their
own devices, the correctest remedy was, as Hood indicated,
the order for a general chase, supplemented by a watchful
supervision, which should check the over-rash and stimulate
the over-cautious. If Hood's account of the sail carried
by Rodney be correct, the Commander-in-Chief did not even
set the best example. In this languid pursuit, the three
crippled French ships were overhauled, and of course had to
strike; and a fourth, the <i>Ardent</i>, 64, was taken, owing to her
indifferent sailing. Towards sunset the flagship <i>Ville de
Paris</i>, 110,<a id="footnotetag125" name="footnotetag125"></a><a href="#footnote125"><sup>125</sup></a> the finest ship of war afloat, having been valiantly
defended against a host of enemies throughout great
part of the afternoon, and having expended all her ammunition,
hauled down her colours. The two British vessels
then immediately engaged with her were the <i>Russell</i> and the
<i>Barfleur</i>, Hood's flagship, to the latter of which she formally
surrendered; the exact moment, noted in Hood's journal, being 6.29 P.M.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg 222]</span>

<p>At 6.45 Rodney made the signal for the fleet to bring-to
(form line and stop) on the port tack, and he remained
lying-to during the night, while the French continued to
retreat under the orders of the Marquis de Vaudreuil, who
by de Grasse's capture had become commander-in-chief. For
this easy-going deliberation also Hood had strong words of condemnation.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Why he should bring the fleet to because the <i>Ville de Paris</i> was
taken, I cannot reconcile. He did not pursue under easy sail, so as
never to have lost sight of the enemy in the night, which would
clearly and most undoubtedly have enabled him to have taken
almost every ship the next day.... Had I had the honour of
commanding his Majesty's noble fleet on the 12th, I may, without
much imputation of vanity, say the flag of England should now have
graced the sterns of <i>upwards</i> of twenty sail of the enemy's ships of
the line."<a id="footnotetag126" name="footnotetag126"></a><a href="#footnote126"><sup>126</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Such criticisms by those not responsible are to be received
generally with caution; but Hood was, in thought and in
deed, a man so much above the common that these cannot be
dismissed lightly. His opinion is known to have been shared
by Sir Charles Douglas, Rodney's Captain of the Fleet;<a id="footnotetag127" name="footnotetag127"></a><a href="#footnote127"><sup>127</sup></a>
and their conclusion is supported by the inferences to be
drawn from Rodney's own assumptions as to the condition
of the French, contrasted with the known facts. The enemy,
he wrote, in assigning his reasons for not pursuing, "went
off in a <i>close connected body</i>,<a id="footnotetag128" name="footnotetag128"></a><a href="#footnote128"><sup>128</sup></a> and might have defeated, by
rotation, the ships that had come up with them." "The
enemy <i>who went off in a body of twenty-six ships of the line</i>,<a id="footnotetag128a" name="footnotetag128a"></a><a href="#footnote128"><sup>128</sup></a>
might, by ordering two or three of their best sailing ships
or frigates to have shown lights at times, and by changing
their course, have induced the British fleet to have followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span>
them, while the main of their fleet, by hiding their lights,
might have hauled their wind, and have been far to windward
by daylight, and intercepted the captured ships, and
the most crippled ships of the English;" and he adds that the
Windward Islands even might have been endangered. That
such action was in a remote degree possible to a well-conditioned
fleet may be guardedly conceded; but it was wildly
improbable to a fleet staggering under such a blow as the
day had seen, which had changed its commander just as
dark came on, and was widely scattered and disordered up
to the moment when signals by flags became invisible.</p>

<p>The facts, however, were utterly at variance with these
ingenious suppositions. Instead of being connected, as Rodney
represents, de Vaudreuil had with him next morning
but ten ships; and no others during the whole of the 13th.
He made sail for Cap Fran&#231;ois, and was joined on the way by
five more, so that at no time were there upwards of fifteen<a id="footnotetag129" name="footnotetag129"></a><a href="#footnote129"><sup>129</sup></a>
French ships of the line together, prior to his arrival at that
port on April 25th. He there found four others of the fleet.
The tale of twenty-five survivors, from the thirty engaged
on April 12th, was completed by six which had gone to
Cura&#231;ao, and which did not rejoin until May. So much
for the close connected body of the French. It is clear,
therefore, that Rodney's reasons illustrate the frame of mind
against which Napoleon used to caution his generals as
"making to themselves a picture" of possibilities; and that
his conclusion at best was based upon the ruinous idea, which
a vivid imagination or slothful temper is prone to present
to itself, that war may be made decisive without running
risks. That Jamaica even was saved was not due to this
fine, but indecisive battle, but to the hesitation of the allies.
When de Vaudreuil reached Cap Fran&#231;ois, he found there the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span>
French convoy safely arrived from Guadeloupe, and also a
body of fifteen Spanish ships of the line. The troops available
for the descent upon Jamaica were from fifteen to twenty
thousand. Well might Hood write: "Had Sir George Rodney's
judgment, after the enemy had been so totally put to
flight, borne any proportion to the high courage, zeal and
exertion, so very manifestly shown by every captain, <i>all</i>
difficulty would now have been at an end. We might have
done just as we pleased, instead of being at this hour upon the defensive."<a id="footnotetag130" name="footnotetag130"></a><a href="#footnote130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>

<p>The allies, however, though superior in numbers, did not
venture to assume the offensive. After the battle, Rodney
remained near Guadeloupe until the 17th of April, refitting,
and searching the neighbouring islands, in case the French
fleet might have entered some one of them. For most of
this time the British were becalmed, but Hood remarks that
there had been wind enough to get twenty leagues to the
westward; and there more wind probably would have been
found. On the 17th Hood was detached in pursuit with ten
sail of the line; and a day or two later Rodney himself
started for Jamaica. Left to his own discretion, Hood pushed
for the Mona Passage, between Puerto Rico and Santo
Domingo, carrying studding-sails below and aloft in his
haste. At daybreak of the 19th he sighted the west end of
Puerto Rico; and soon afterwards a small French squadron
was seen. A general chase resulted in the capture of the
<i>Jason</i> and <i>Caton</i>, sixty-fours, which had parted from their
fleet before the battle and were on their way to Cap Fran&#231;ois.
A frigate, the <i>Aimable</i>, 32, and a sloop, the <i>C&#233;r&#232;s</i>,
18, also were taken. In reporting this affair to Rodney,
Hood got a thrust into his superior. "It is a very mortifying
circumstance to relate to you, Sir, that the French fleet
which you put to flight on the 12th went through the Mona
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg 225]</span>
Channel on the 18th, only the day before I was in it."<a id="footnotetag131" name="footnotetag131"></a><a href="#footnote131"><sup>131</sup></a> A
further proof of the utility of pursuit, here hinted at, is to
be found in the fact that Rodney, starting six days later than
de Vaudreuil, reached Jamaica, April 28th, only three days
after the French got into Cap Fran&#231;ois. He had therefore
gained three days in a fortnight's run. What might not have
been done by an untiring chase! But a remark recorded
by Hood summed up the frame of mind which dominated
Rodney: "I lamented to Sir George on the 13th that the signal
for a general chase was not made when that for the line
was hauled down and that he did not continue to pursue so
as to keep sight of the enemy all night, to which he only
answered, 'Come, we have done very handsomely as it is.'"<a id="footnotetag132" name="footnotetag132"></a><a href="#footnote132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>

<p>Rodney stayed at Jamaica until the 10th of July, when
Admiral Hugh Pigot arrived from England to supersede him.
This change was consequent upon the fall of Lord North's
ministry, in March, 1782, and had been decided before the
news of the victory could reach England. Admiral Keppel
now became the head of the Admiralty. Rodney sailed for
home from Port Royal on the 22d of July; and with his
departure the war in the West Indies and North America
may be said to have ended. Pigot started almost immediately
for New York, and remained in North American waters
until the end of October, when he returned to Barbados,
first having detached Hood with thirteen ships of the line
from the main fleet, to cruise off Cap Fran&#231;ois. It is of interest
to note that at this time Hood took with him from New York
the frigate <i>Albemarle</i>, 28, then commanded by Nelson, who
had been serving on the North American station. These
various movements were dictated by those of the enemy, either
actually made or supposed to be in contemplation; for it was
an inevitable part of the ill-effects of Rodney's most imperfect
success, that the British fleet was thenceforth on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg 226]</span>
defensive purely, with all the perplexities of him who waits
upon the initiative of an opponent. Nothing came of them
all, however, for the war now was but lingering in its death
stupor. The defeat of de Grasse, partial though it was; the
abandonment of the enterprise upon Jamaica; the failure
of the attack upon Gibraltar; and the success of Howe in
re-victualling that fortress,&mdash;these had taken all heart out
of the French and Spaniards; while the numerical superiority
of the allies, inefficiently though it had been used heretofore,
weighed heavily upon the imagination of the British Government,
which now had abandoned all hope of subduing its
American Colonies. Upon the conclusion of peace, in 1783,
Pigot and Hood returned to England, leaving the Leeward
Islands' Station under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir
Richard Hughes, an officer remembered by history only
through Nelson's refusing to obey his orders not to enforce
the Navigation Acts, in 1785.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>HOWE AGAIN GOES AFLOAT. THE FINAL RELIEF OF GIBRALTAR<br />

1782</h3>


<p>The fall of Lord North's Ministry, besides occasioning
the recall of Rodney, drew Lord
Howe out of his long retirement, to command
the Channel Fleet. He hoisted his flag on the
20th of April, 1782, on board the <i>Victory</i>, 100. Owing to
the various directions in which the efforts of Great Britain
had to be made, either to defend her own interests or to crush
the movements of the many enemies now combined against
her, the operations of the Channel fleet were for some months
carried on by detached squadrons,&mdash;in the North Sea, in
the Bay of Biscay, and at the entrance of the Channel;
Howe having under him several distinguished subordinates,
at the head of whom, in professional reputation, were Vice-Admiral
Barrington, the captor of Santa Lucia, and Rear-Admiral
Kempenfelt. In the North Sea, the Dutch were
kept in their ports; and a convoy of near 400 merchant
ships from the Baltic reached England unmolested. In the
Bay of Biscay, Barrington, having with him twelve of the
line, discovered and chased a convoy laden with stores for
the fleet in the East Indies. One of the ships of the line
accompanying it, the <i>P&#233;gase</i>, 74, surrendered, after a night
action of three hours with the <i>Foudroyant</i>, 80, Captain John
Jervis, afterwards Earl St. Vincent. Of nineteen transports,
thirteen, one of which, the <i>Actionnaire</i>, was a 64-gun ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span>
armed <i>en fl&#251;te</i>,<a id="footnotetag133" name="footnotetag133"></a><a href="#footnote133"><sup>133</sup></a> were taken; a weighty blow to the great
Suffren, whose chief difficulty in India was inadequate
material of war, and especially of spars, of which the <i>Actionnaire</i>
carried an outfit for four ships of the line. After Barrington's
return, Kempenfelt made a similar but uneventful cruise of a month in the Bay.</p>

<p>Howe himself went first to the North Sea in the month of
May. Having there held the Dutch in check during a critical
moment, he was directed next to go to the entrance of
the Channel, leaving only a division in the Downs. Information
had been received that an allied fleet of thirty-two
ships of the line, five only of which were French, had sailed
from Cadiz early in June, to cruise between Ushant and
Scilly. It was expected that they would be joined there by
a reinforcement from Brest, and by the Dutch squadron in
the Texel, making a total of about fifty of the line, under
the command of the Spanish Admiral, Don Luis de Cordova.
The Dutch did not appear, owing probably to Howe's demonstration
before their ports; but eight ships from Brest raised
the allied fleet to forty. To oppose these Howe sailed on
the 2d of July with twenty-two sail, of which eight were
three-deckers. Before his return, in the 7th of August, he
was joined by eight others; mostly, however, sixty-fours.
With this inferiority of numbers the British Admiral could
expect only to act on the defensive, unless some specially
favourable opportunity should offer. The matter of most
immediate concern was the arrival of the Jamaica convoy,
then daily expected; with which, it may be mentioned, de
Grasse also was returning to England, a prisoner of war on
board the <i>Sandwich</i>.</p>

<p>On its voyage north, the allied fleet captured on June 25th
eighteen ships of a British convoy bound for Canada. A few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg 229]</span>
days later it was fixed in the chops of the Channel, covering
the ground from Ushant to Scilly. On the evening of July
7th it was sighted off Scilly by Howe, who then had with him
twenty-five sail. The allies prepared for action; but the
British Admiral, possessing a thorough knowledge of the
neighbouring coasts, either in his own person or in some of
his officers, led the fleet by night to the westward through the
passage between Scilly and Land's End. On the following
morning he was no more to be seen, and the enemy, ignorant
of the manner of his evasion, was thrown wholly off his track.<a id="footnotetag134" name="footnotetag134"></a><a href="#footnote134"><sup>134</sup></a>
Howe met the convoy; and a strong gale of wind afterwards
forcing the allies to the southward, both it and the fleet
slipped by successfully, and reached England.</p>

<p>Howe was ordered now to prepare to throw reinforcements
and supplies into Gibraltar, which had not received relief
since Darby's visit, in April, 1781. For this urgent and
critical service it was determined to concentrate the whole
Channel Fleet at Spithead, where also the transports and
supply-ships were directed to rendezvous. It was while
thus assembling for the relief of Gibraltar that there occurred
the celebrated incident of the <i>Royal George</i>, a 100-gun ship,
while being heeled for under-water repairs, oversetting and
sinking at her anchors, carrying down with her Rear-Admiral
Kempenfelt and about nine hundred souls, including many
women and children. This was on the 29th of August, 1782.
On the 11th of September the expedition started, one hundred
and eighty-three sail in all; thirty-four being ships of the line,
with a dozen smaller cruisers, the rest unarmed vessels. Of
the latter, thirty-one were destined for Gibraltar, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg 230]</span>
remainder being trading ships for different parts of the world.
With so extensive a charge, the danger to which had been
emphasised by numerous captures from convoys during the
war, Howe's progress was slow. It is told that shortly before
reaching Cape Finisterre, but after a violent gale of wind,
the full tally of one hundred eighty-three sail was counted.
After passing Finisterre, the several "trades" probably
parted from the grand fleet.</p>

<p>On the 8th of October, off Cape St. Vincent, a frigate
was sent ahead for information. It was known that a great
combined force of ships of war lay in Algeciras Bay,&mdash;opposite
Gibraltar,&mdash;and that an attack upon the works was in
contemplation; but much might have happened meantime.
Much, in fact, had happened. A violent gale of wind on
the 10th of September had driven some of the allied fleet
from their moorings, one vessel, the <i>San Miguel</i>, 72, being
forced under the batteries of Gibraltar, where she had to
surrender; but there still remained the formidable number of
forty-eight ships of the line, anchored only four miles from the
point which the relief ships must reach. This was the problem
which Howe had to solve. More important still, though of less
bearing upon his mission, was the cheering news brought by
the frigate, when she rejoined on October 10th, that the long-intended
attack had been made on the 13th of September,
and had been repelled gloriously and decisively. The heavily
protected Spanish floating batteries, from which success had
been expected confidently, one and all had been set on fire
and destroyed. If Howe could introduce his succours, the fortress was saved.</p>

<p>The admiral at once summoned his subordinate officers,
gave them full and particular instructions for the momentous
undertaking, and issued at the same time, to the masters of
the supply-ships, precise information as to local conditions
of wind and currents at Gibraltar, to enable them more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg 231]</span>
surely to reach their anchorage. On the 11th of October,
being now close to its destination, the fleet bore up for the
Straits, which it entered at noon with a fair westerly wind.
The convoy went first,&mdash;sailing before the wind it was thus
to leeward of the fleet, in a position to be defended,&mdash;and
the ships of war followed at some distance in three divisions,
one of which was led by Howe himself. At 6 P.M. the supply-ships
were off the mouth of the Bay, with a wind fair for the
mole; but, through neglect of the instructions given, all but
four missed the entrance, and were swept to the eastward
of the Rock, whither the fleet of course had to follow them.</p>

<p>On the 13th the allied fleets came out, being induced to
quit their commanding position at Algeciras by fears for
two of their number, which shortly before had been driven
to the eastward. During the forenoon of the same day the
British were off the Spanish coast, fifty miles east of Gibraltar.
At sunset the allies were seen approaching, and Howe formed
his fleet, but sent the supply-ships to anchor at the Zaffarine
Islands, on the coast of Barbary, to await events. Next morning
the enemy was close to land northward, but visible only
from the mastheads; the British apparently having headed
south during the night. On the 15th the wind came east, fair
for Gibraltar, towards which all the British began cautiously
to move. By the evening of the 16th, eighteen of the convoy
were safe at the mole; and on the 18th all had arrived, besides
a fireship with 1,500 barrels of powder, sent in by the
Admiral upon the governor's requisition. Throughout these
critical hours, the combined fleets seem to have been out of
sight. Either intentionally or carelessly, they had got to
the eastward and there remained; having rallied their separated
ships, but allowed Gibraltar to be replenished for a year.
On the morning of the 19th they appeared in the north-east,
but the relief was then accomplished and Howe put out to
sea. He was not willing to fight in mid-Straits, embarrassed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg 232]</span>
by currents and the land; but when outside he brought-to,&mdash;stopped,
by backing some of the sails,&mdash;to allow the
enemy to attack if they would, they having the weather-gage.
On the following day, the 20th, towards sunset they
bore down, and a partial engagement ensued; but it was
wholly indecisive, and next day was not renewed. The
British loss was 68 killed and 208 wounded; that of the allies
60 killed and 320 wounded. On the 14th of November the fleet regained Spithead.</p>

<p>The services rendered to his country by Howe on this
occasion were eminently characteristic of the special qualities
of that great officer, in whom was illustrated to the highest
degree the solid strength attainable by a man not brilliant,
but most able, who gives himself heart and soul to professional
acquirement. In him, profound and extensive professional
knowledge, which is not inborn but gained, was joined
to great natural staying powers; and the combination eminently
fitted him for the part we have seen him play in Delaware
Bay, at New York, before Rhode Island, in the Channel,
and now at Gibraltar. The utmost of skill, the utmost of
patience, the utmost of persistence, such had Howe; and
having these, he was particularly apt for the defensive operations,
upon the conduct of which chiefly must rest his well-deserved renown.</p>

<p>A true and noble tribute has been paid by a French officer
to this relief of Gibraltar:<a id="footnotetag135" name="footnotetag135"></a><a href="#footnote135"><sup>135</sup></a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The qualities displayed by Lord Howe during this short campaign
rose to the full height of the mission which he had to fulfil.
This operation, one of the finest in the War of American Independence,
merits a praise equal to that of a victory. If the English fleet
was favoured by circumstances,&mdash;and it is rare that in such enterprises
one can succeed without the aid of fortune&mdash;it was above all
the Commander-in-Chief's quickness of perception, the accuracy of
his judgment, and the rapidity of his decisions, that assured success."
</p></blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span>

<p>To this well-weighed, yet lofty praise of the Admiral, the
same writer has added words that the British Navy may
remember long with pride, as sealing the record of this war,
of which the relief of Gibraltar marked the close in European
and American waters. After according credit to the
Admiralty for the uniform high speed of the British vessels,
and to Howe for his comprehension and use of this advantage,
Captain Chevalier goes on:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Finally, if we may judge by the results, the Commander-in-Chief
of the English fleet could not but think himself most happy in
his captains. There were neither separations, nor collisions, nor
casualties; and there occurred none of those events, so frequent
in the experiences of a squadron, which often oblige admirals to take
a course wholly contrary to the end they have in view. In contemplation
of this unvexed navigation of Admiral Howe, it is impossible
not to recall the unhappy incidents which from the 9th to
the 12th of April befell the squadron of the Count de Grasse.... If
it is just to admit that Lord Howe displayed the highest talent,
it should be added that he had in his hands excellent instruments."

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE NAVAL OPERATIONS IN THE EAST INDIES,
1778-1783. THE CAREER OF THE BAILLI DE SUFFREN</h3>


<p>The operations in India, both naval and military,
stand by themselves, without direct influence
upon transactions elsewhere, and unaffected
also by these, except in so far as necessary
succours were intercepted sometimes in European waters.
The cause of this isolation was the distance of India from
Europe; from four to six months being required by a fleet for the voyage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/234.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/234.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Peninsula of India, and Ceylon</div>

<p>Certain intelligence of the war between Great Britain and
France reached Calcutta July 7th, 1778. On the same day
the Governor-General ordered immediate preparations to
attack Pondicherry, the principal seaport of the French.
The army arrived before the place on the 8th of August,
and on the same day Commodore Sir Edward Vernon anchored
in the roads to blockade by sea. A French squadron,
under Captain Tronjoly, soon after appearing in the offing,
Vernon gave chase, and on the 10th an action ensued. The
forces engaged were about equal, the French, if anything,
slightly superior; a 60-gun ship and four smaller vessels
being on each side. As the French then went into Pondicherry,
the immediate advantage may be conceded to them;
but, Vernon returning on the 20th, Tronjoly soon after
quitted the roads, and returned to the Ile de France.<a id="footnotetag136" name="footnotetag136"></a><a href="#footnote136"><sup>136</sup></a> From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg 235]</span>
that day the British squadron blockaded closely, and on the
17th of October Pondicherry capitulated.</p>

<p>On the 7th of March, 1779, Rear-Admiral Sir Edward
Hughes sailed for the East Indies with a small squadron.
The French also sent out occasional ships; but in
1779 and 1780 these went no further than the Ile de France,
their naval station in the Indian Ocean. Hughes's force
remained unopposed during those years. The period was
critical, for the British were at war with Hyder Ali, Sultan of
Mysore, and with the Mahrattas; and all depended upon
command of the sea. In January, 1781, when Hughes was
wintering at Bombay, the French squadron under Comte
d'Orves appeared off the Coromandel coast, but, despite
Hyder Ali's entreaties, it refused to co&#246;perate with him.
The different spirit of the two commanders may be illustrated
from contemporary documents.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"We have advices from Fort St. George of a French squadron
which appeared off that place on January 25, 26, and 27, consisting
of 1 seventy-four, 4 sixty-fours, and 2 fifties. They proceeded south
without making any attempt on five Indiamen then in the roads,
with a number of vessels laden with grain and provisions; the destroying
of which might have been easily accomplished, and would
have been severely felt."
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
"On December 8th, off Mangalore,"<a id="footnotetag137" name="footnotetag137"></a><a href="#footnote137"><sup>137</sup></a> writes Hughes, "I saw two
ships, a large snow, three ketches, and many smaller vessels at
anchor in the road with Hyder's flag flying; and, standing close,
found them vessels of force and all armed for war. I anchored as
close as possible, sent in all armed boats, under cover of three smaller
ships of war, which anchored in four fathoms water, close to the
enemy's ships. In two hours took and burned the two ships, one
of 28 and one of 26 guns, and took or destroyed all the others, save
one which, by throwing everything overboard, escaped over the bar
into the port. Lost 1 lieutenant and 10 men killed, 2 lieutenants
and 51 wounded."
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to note these evidences of Hughes's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg 236]</span>
conceptions of naval warfare and enterprise, common though
they were to the British service; for their positive character
brings into strong relief the qualities of his next antagonist,
Suffren, and his great superiority in these respects over the
average run of French officers of that day.</p>

<p>D'Orves returned to the Ile de France.</p>

<p>When war with Holland began, the British government
decided to attempt the capture of the Cape of Good Hope.
For that object a squadron of one 74, one 64, and three 50's,
with numerous smaller vessels, under Commodore George
Johnstone, convoying a considerable body of troops, sailed
from England on the 13th of March, 1781, in company with
the Channel fleet under Vice-Admiral George Darby, then
on its way to relieve Gibraltar. The French government,
having timely notice of the expedition, undertook to frustrate
it; detailing for that purpose a division of two 74's,
and three 64's, under the since celebrated Suffren.<a id="footnotetag139" name="footnotetag139"></a><a href="#footnote139"><sup>139</sup></a> These
ships left Brest on the 22d of March, with the fleet of
de Grasse. They also carried some battalions of troops.</p>

<p>On April 11th the British squadron reached Porto Praya,
Cape de Verde Islands. This bay is open to the southward,
extending from east to west about a mile and a half, and is
within the limits of the north-east trade-winds. Although
aware that a French division was on his track, and conscious,
by the admissions of his report, that protection could not be
expected from the neutrality of the place, Johnstone permitted
his vessels to anchor without reference to attack.
His own flagship, the <i>Romney</i>, 50, was so surrounded by
others that she could fire only with great caution through
intervals. On the 16th of April, at 9.30 A.M., the <i>Isis</i>, 50,
which was the outermost of the British squadron, signalled
eleven sail in the north-east. Fifteen hundred persons were
then ashore engaged in watering, fishing, embarking cattle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span>
and amusing themselves. The strangers were Suffren's division.
The meeting was not expected by the French commander,
whose object in entering was simply to complete
the water of the ships; but he determined at once to attack,
and hauled round the east point of the bay in column, the
two seventy-fours at the head, his own ship, the <i>H&#233;ros</i>,
leading with the signal for battle (line ab). Passing through,
or along, the disordered enemy until he reached the only
seventy-four among them, he there luffed to the wind, anchoring
five hundred feet from the starboard beam of this
vessel (f) which by an odd coincidence bore the same name&mdash;<i>Hero</i>.
From this position he at once opened fire from both
broadsides. His next astern, the <i>Annibal</i> (b), brought up
immediately ahead of him, but so close that the <i>H&#233;ros</i> had
to veer cable and drop astern (a), which brought her on the
beam of the <i>Monmouth</i>, 64<a id="footnotetag140" name="footnotetag140"></a><a href="#footnote140"><sup>140</sup></a> (m). The captain of the <i>Annibal</i>
had thought the order for battle merely precautionary, and
had not cleared for action. He was therefore taken unawares,
and his ship did no service proportionate to her force.
The third French vessel (c) reached her station, but her
captain was struck dead just when about to anchor, and in
the confusion the anchor was not let go. The ship drifted
foul of a British East Indiaman, which she carried out to
sea (c' c"). The two remaining French (d, e) simply cannonaded
as they passed across the bay's mouth, failing through
mishap or awkwardness to reach an effective position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/237.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/237.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Johnstone and Suffren, Porto Praya, April 16, 1781</div>

<p>The attack thus became a mere rough and tumble, in which
the two seventy-fours alone sustained the French side.
After three quarters of an hour, Suffren, seeing that the
attempt had failed, slipped his cable and put to sea. The
<i>Annibal</i> followed, but she had been so damaged that all her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg 238]</span>
masts went overboard; fortunately, not until her head was
pointed out of the harbour. Johnstone, thus luckily escaping
the consequences of his neglect, now called his captains
together to learn the condition of their ships, and then ordered
them to cut their cables and pursue. All obeyed except
Captain Sutton of the <i>Isis</i>, who represented that the spars
and rigging of his ship could not bear sail at once. Johnstone
then ordered him to come out anyhow, which he did,
and his fore topmast shortly went overboard. The disability
of this ship so weighed upon the Commodore that
his pursuit was exceedingly sluggish; and the French kept
drawing him away to leeward, the <i>Annibal</i> having got a bit
of canvas on a jury foremast. Night, therefore, was falling
as Johnstone came near them; the <i>Isis</i> and <i>Monmouth</i>
were two or three miles astern; the sea was increasing;
if he got much further to leeward, he could not get back;
he had forgotten to appoint a rendezvous where the convoy
might rejoin; a night action, he considered, was not to be
thought of. Yet, if he let the enemy go, they might anticipate
him at the Cape. In short, Johnstone underwent the
"anguish" of an undecided man in a "cruel situation,"<a id="footnotetag141" name="footnotetag141"></a><a href="#footnote141"><sup>141</sup></a>
and of course decided to run no risks. He returned therefore
to Porto Praya, put the captain of the <i>Isis</i> under arrest, and
remained in port for a fortnight. Suffren hurried on to the
Cape, got there first, landed his troops, and secured the
colony against attack. Johnstone arrived in the neighbourhood
some time later, and, finding himself anticipated,
turned aside to Saldanha Bay, where he captured five Dutch
East Indiamen. He then sent the <i>Hero</i>, <i>Monmouth</i>, and
<i>Isis</i> on to India, to reinforce Hughes, and himself went back to England.</p>

<p>No accusation of misbehavior lies against any of the
British subordinates in this affair of Porto Praya. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg 239]</span>
captain of the <i>Isis</i> was brought to a court-martial, and
honourably acquitted of all the charges. The discredit of
the surprise was not redeemed by any exhibition of intelligence,
energy, or professional capacity, on the part of the
officer in charge. It has been said that he never had commanded
a post-ship<a id="footnotetag142" name="footnotetag142"></a><a href="#footnote142"><sup>142</sup></a> before he was intrusted with this very
important mission, and it is reasonably sure that his selection
for it was due to attacks made by him upon the professional
conduct of Keppel and Howe, when those admirals were at
variance with the administration.<a id="footnotetag143" name="footnotetag143"></a><a href="#footnote143"><sup>143</sup></a> His preposterous mismanagement,
therefore, was probably not wholly bitter to the
Navy at large. In the British ships of war, the entire loss
in men, as reported, was only 9 killed, 47 wounded. Several
casualties from chance shots occurred on board the convoy,
bringing up the total to 36 killed and 130 wounded. The
French admit 105 killed and 204 wounded, all but 19 being
in the <i>H&#233;ros</i> and <i>Annibal</i>. Although precipitated by Suffren,
the affair clearly was as great a surprise to his squadron as to
the British. Therefore, the latter, being already at anchor
and more numerous as engaged, had a distinct advantage;
to which also contributed musketry fire from the transports.
Nevertheless, the result cannot be deemed creditable to the
French captains or gunnery.</p>

<p>Suffren remained in the neighbourhood of the Cape for two
months. Then, having seen the colony secure, independent
of his squadron, he departed for the Ile de France, arriving
there October 25th. On the 17th of December the whole
French force, under the command of d'Orves, sailed for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span>
Coromandel coast. On the way the British 50-gun ship
<i>Hannibal</i>, Captain Alexander Christie, was taken. On the
9th of February, 1782, Comte d'Orves died, and Suffren
found himself at the head of twelve ships of the line: three
74's, seven 64's and two 50's.<a id="footnotetag144" name="footnotetag144"></a><a href="#footnote144"><sup>144</sup></a> On the 15th Hughes's
fleet was sighted, under the guns of Madras. It numbered
nine of the line: two 74's, one 68, five 64's, and one 50.
Suffren stood south towards Pondicherry, which had passed
into the power of Hyder Ali. After nightfall Hughes got
under way, and also steered south. He feared for Trincomalee,
in Ceylon, recently a Dutch port, which the
British had captured on the 5th of January. It was a
valuable naval position, as yet most imperfectly defended.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/240.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/240.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Hughes and Suffren, February 17, 1782</div>

<p>At daylight the British saw the French squadron twelve
miles east (A, A) and its transports nine miles south-west
(c). Hughes chased the latter and took six. Suffren pursued,
but could not overtake before sunset, and both fleets
steered south-east during the night. Next morning there
were light north-north-east airs, and the French were six
miles north-east of the British (B, B). The latter formed
line on the port tack (a), heading to seaward; Hughes
hoping that thus the usual sea-breeze would find him to windward.
The breeze, however, did not make as expected;
and, as the north-east puffs were bringing the enemy down,
he kept off before the wind (b) to gain time for his ships to
close their intervals, which were too great. At 4 P.M. the
near approach of the French compelled him to form line
again, (C), on the port tack, heading easterly. The rear
ship, <i>Exeter</i>, 64 (e), was left separated, out of due support
from those ahead. Suffren, leading one section of his fleet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg 241]</span>
in person, passed to windward of the British line, from the
rear, as far as Hughes's flagship, which was fifth from the
van. There he stopped, and kept at half cannon-shot, to
prevent the four ships in the British van from tacking to
relieve their consorts. It was his intention that the second
half of his fleet should attack the other side of the English rear.
This plan of intended battle is shown by the figure D in the
diagram. Actually, only two of the French rear did what
Suffren expected, engaging to leeward of the extreme British
rear; the others of the French rear remaining long out of
action (C). The figure C shows the imperfect achievement
of the design D. However, as the position of Suffren's
flagship prevented the British van from tacking into action,
the net result was, to use Hughes's own words, that "the
enemy brought eight of their best ships to the attack of five
of ours." It will be noted with interest that these were
exactly the numbers engaged in the first act of the battle of
the Nile. The <i>Exeter</i> (like the <i>Guerrier</i> at the Nile) received
the fresh broadsides of the first five of the enemy, and then
remained in close action on both sides, assailed by two,
and at last by three, opponents,&mdash;two 50's, and one
64. When the third approached, the master of the
ship asked Commodore Richard King, whose broad pennant
flew at her masthead, "What is to be done?" "There is
nothing to be done," replied King, "but to fight her till she
sinks." Her loss, 10 killed and 45 wounded, was not creditable
under the circumstances to the French gunnery, which
had been poor also at Porto Praya. At 6 P.M. the wind shifted
to south-east, throwing all on the other tack, and enabling
the British van at last to come into action. Darkness now
approaching, Suffren hauled off and anchored at Pondicherry.
Hughes went on to Trincomalee to refit. The British loss had
been 32 killed, among whom were Captain William Stevens
of the flagship, and Captain Henry Reynolds, of the <i>Exeter</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg 242]</span>
and 83 wounded. The French had 30 killed; the number of
their wounded is put by Professor Laughton at 100.</p>

<p>On the 12th of March Hughes returned to Madras, and
towards the end of the month sailed again for Trincomalee
carrying reinforcements and supplies. On the 30th he was
joined at sea by the <i>Sultan</i>, 74, and the <i>Magnanime</i>, 64, just
from England. Suffren had remained on the coast from
reasons of policy, to encourage Hyder Ali in his leaning to
the French; but, after landing a contingent of troops on the
22d of March, to assist at the siege of the British port of
Cuddalore, he put to sea on the 23d, and went south, hoping
to intercept the <i>Sultan</i> and <i>Magnanime</i> off the south end of
Ceylon. On the 9th of April he sighted the British fleet to
the south and west of him. Hughes, attaching the first importance
to the strengthening of Trincomalee, had resolved
neither to seek nor to shun action. He therefore continued
his course, light northerly airs prevailing, until the 11th,
when, being about fifty miles to the north-east of his port, he
bore away for it. Next morning, April 12th, finding that the
enemy could overtake his rear ships, he formed line on the
starboard tack, at two cables' intervals, heading to the westward,
towards the coast of Ceylon, wind north by east, and
the French dead to windward (A, A). Suffren drew up his
line (a) on the same tack, parallel to the British, and at 11
A.M. gave the signal to steer west-south-west all together;
his vessels going down in a slanting direction (bb'), each
to steer for one of the enemy. Having twelve ships to
eleven, the twelfth was ordered to place herself on the off
side of the rear British, which would thus have two antagonists.</p>

Hughes and Suffren, April 12, 1782<br />
Hughes and Suffren, July 6, 1782</div>

<p>In such simultaneous approach it commonly occurred that
the attacking line ceased to be parallel with the foe's, its van
becoming nearer and rear more distant. So it was here.
Further, the British opening fire as soon as the leading French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg 243]</span>
were within range, the latter at once hauled up to reply.
Suffren, in the centre, wishing closest action, signalled them
to keep away again, and himself bore down wrathfully upon
Hughes to within pistol-shot; in which he was supported
closely by his next ahead and the two next astern. The
rear of the French, though engaged, remained too far distant.
Their line, therefore, resembled a curve, the middle of which&mdash;four
or five ships&mdash;was tangent to the British centre (B).
At this point the heat of the attack fell upon Hughes's flagship,
the <i>Superb</i>, 74 (C, d), and her next ahead, the <i>Monmouth</i>,
64. Suffren's ship, the <i>H&#233;ros</i>, having much of her
rigging cut, could not shorten sail, shot by the <i>Superb</i>, and
brought up abreast the <i>Monmouth</i>. The latter, already hotly
engaged by one of her own class, and losing her main and
mizzen masts in this unequal new contest, was forced at 3
P.M. to bear up out of the line (m). The place of the <i>H&#233;ros</i>
alongside the <i>Superb</i> was taken by the <i>Orient</i>, 74, supported
by the <i>Brillant</i>, 64; and when the <i>Monmouth</i> kept off, the
attack of these two ships was reinforced by the half-dozen
stern chasers of the <i>H&#233;ros</i>, which had drifted into the British
line, and now fired into the <i>Superb's</i> bows. The conflict
between these five ships, two British and three French, was
one of the bloodiest in naval annals; the loss of the <i>Superb</i>,
59 killed and 96 wounded, and of the <i>Monmouth</i>, 45 killed
and 102 wounded, equalling that of the much larger vessels
which bore the flags of Nelson and Collingwood at Trafalgar.
The loss of the three French was 52 killed and 142 wounded;
but to this should be added properly that of the <i>Sphinx</i>, 64,
the <i>Monmouth's</i> first adversary: 22 killed and 74 wounded.
At 3.40 P.M., fearing that if he continued steering west he
would get entangled with the shore, Hughes wore his ships,
forming line on the port tack, heading off shore. The
French also wore, and Suffren hoped to secure the <i>Monmouth</i>,
which was left between the two lines; but the quickness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg 244]</span>
of a British captain, Hawker, of the <i>Hero</i>, ran a tow-rope
to her in time, and she was thus dragged out of danger. At
5.40 Hughes anchored, and Suffren did the same at 8 P.M.
The total British loss in men on this occasion was 137 killed
and 430 wounded; that of the French 137 killed, and 357 wounded.</p>

<p>The exhausted enemies remained at anchor in the open sea,
two miles apart, for a week, repairing. On the 19th of
April the French got under way and made a demonstration
before the British, inviting battle, yet not attacking; but
the condition of the <i>Monmouth</i> forbade Hughes from moving.
Suffren therefore departed to Batacalo, in Ceylon, south of
Trincomalee, where he covered his own convoys from Europe,
and flanked the approach of his adversary's. Hughes, on
the 22d of April, got into Trincomalee, where he remained
till June 23d. He then went to Negapatam, formerly a
Dutch possession, but then held by the British. There he
learned that Suffren, who meanwhile had captured several
British transports, was a few miles north of him, at
Cuddalore, which had surrendered to Hyder Ali on April
4th. On the 5th of July, at 1 P.M., the French squadron
appeared. At 3 P.M. Hughes put to sea, and stood south
during the night to gain the wind,&mdash;the south-west monsoon now blowing.</p>

<p>Next morning, at daylight, the French were seen at anchor,
seven or eight miles to leeward. At 6 A.M. they began to get
under way. One of their sixty-fours, the <i>Ajax</i>, had lost her
main and mizzen topmasts in a violent squall on the previous
afternoon, and was not in the line. There were therefore
eleven ships on each side. The action, known as that of
Negapatam, began shortly before 11, when both fleets were
on the starboard tack, heading south-south-east, wind south-west.
The British being to windward, Hughes ordered his
fleet to bear up together to the attack, exactly as Suffren
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span>
had done on the 12th of April. As commonly happened, the
rear got less close than the van (Position I). The fourth ship
in the French order, the <i>Brillant</i>, 64 (a), losing her mainmast
early, dropped to leeward of the line, (a'), and astern
of her place (a"). At half-past noon the wind flew suddenly
to south-south-east,&mdash;the sea-breeze,&mdash;taking the ships
a little on the port bow. Most of them, on both sides, paid
off from the enemy, the British to starboard, the French to
port; but between the main lines, which were in the momentary
confusion consequent upon such an incident, were left
six ships&mdash;four British and two French&mdash;that had turned
the other way (Positions II and III).<a id="footnotetag145" name="footnotetag145"></a><a href="#footnote145"><sup>145</sup></a> These were the
<i>Burford</i>, <i>Sultan</i> (s), <i>Worcester</i>, and <i>Eagle</i>, fourth,
fifth, eighth
and tenth, in the British order; and the <i>S&#233;v&#232;re</i> (b), third in
the French, with the dismasted <i>Brillant</i>, which was now
towards the rear of the fight (a). Under these conditions,
the <i>S&#233;v&#232;re</i>, 64, underwent a short but close action with the
<i>Sultan</i>, 74; and with two other British ships, according to
the report of the <i>S&#233;v&#232;re's</i> captain. The remainder of the
incident shall be given in the latter's own words.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Seeing the French squadron drawing off,&mdash;for all the ships
except the <i>Brillant</i> had fallen off on the other tack,&mdash;Captain de
Cillart thought it useless to prolong his defence, and had the flag
hauled down. The ships engaged with him immediately ceased
their fire, and the one on the starboard side moved away. At this
moment the <i>S&#233;v&#232;re</i> fell off to starboard, and her sails filled. Captain
de Cillart then ordered the fire to be resumed by his lower-deck guns,
the only ones which remained manned, and he rejoined his
squadron."
</p></blockquote>

<p>When the <i>S&#233;v&#232;re's</i> flag came down, Suffren was approaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg 246]</span>
with his flagship. The <i>Sultan</i> wore to rejoin her fleet, and
was raked by the <i>S&#233;v&#232;re</i> in so doing. The <i>Brillant</i>, whose
mainmast had been shot away in conflict with either the
<i>Sultan</i> or the <i>Burford</i>, both much heavier ships, had at this
later phase of the fight fallen under the guns of the <i>Worcester</i>
and the <i>Eagle</i>. Her captain, de Saint-F&#233;lix, was one of the
most resolute of Suffren's officers. She was rescued by the
flagship, but she had lost 47 killed and 136 wounded,&mdash;an
almost incredible slaughter, being over a third of the
usual complement of a sixty-four; and Suffren's ships were undermanned.</p>

<p>These spirited episodes, and the fact that his four separated
ships were approaching the enemy, and being approached by
them, caused Hughes to give the orders to wear, and for a
general chase; the flag for the line being hauled down. These
signals would bring all the main body to the support of the
separated ships, without regard to their order in battle, and
therefore with the utmost expedition that their remaining
sail power would admit. Two of the fleet, however, made
signals of disability; so Hughes annulled the orders, and at
1.30 formed on the port tack, recalling the engaged vessels.
Both squadrons now stood in shore, and anchored at about
6 P.M.; the British near Negapatam, the French some ten
miles north. The loss in the action had been: British, 77
killed, 233 wounded; French, 178 killed, 601 wounded.</p>

<p>On the following day Suffren sailed for Cuddalore. There
he received word that two ships of the line&mdash;the <i>Illustre</i>,
74, and <i>St. Michel</i>, 60, with a convoy of supplies and 600
troops&mdash;were to be expected shortly at Pointe de Galle,
then a Dutch port, on the south-west side of Ceylon. It
was essential to cover these, and on the 18th he was ready for
sea; but the necessity of an interview with Hyder Ali delayed
him until the 1st of August, when he started for Batacalo.
On the 9th he arrived there, and on the 21st the reinforcement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg 247]</span>
joined him. Within forty-eight hours the supply-ships
were cleared, and the squadron sailed again with the
object of taking Trincomalee. On the 25th he was off the
port, and, the operation being pushed energetically, the
place capitulated on the 31st of August.</p>

<p>It is difficult to resist the impression that greater energy on
Hughes's part might have brought him up in time to prevent
this mishap. He reached Madras only on July 20th, a
fortnight after the late action; and he did not sail thence
until the 20th of August, notwithstanding that he apprehended
an attempt upon Trincomalee. Hence, when he
arrived there on the 2d of September, not only had it passed
into the hands of the enemy, but Suffren had re&#235;mbarked
already the men and the guns that had been landed from his
fleet. When Hughes's approach was signalled, all preparations
for sea were hastened, and the following morning, at
daybreak, the French came out. Hughes had been joined
since the last action by the <i>Sceptre</i>, 64, so that the respective
forces in the action fought off Trincomalee on September
3d were twelve of the line to fourteen, viz.: British, three 74's,
one 70, one 68, six 64's, one 50; French, four 74's, seven
64's, one 60, two 50's. Suffren had also put into the line a
36-gun ship, the <i>Consolante</i>.<a id="footnotetag146" name="footnotetag146"></a><a href="#footnote146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>

<p>While the French were getting underway from Trincomalee,
the British fleet was standing south-south-east towards the
entrance, close-hauled on the starboard tack, a fresh south-west
monsoon blowing. When Hughes made out the hostile
flags on the works, he kept away four points,<a id="footnotetag147" name="footnotetag147"></a><a href="#footnote147"><sup>147</sup></a> and steered
east-south-east, still in column, under short canvas (A).
Suffren pursued, being to windward yet astern, with his
fleet on a line of bearing; that is, the line on which the
ships were ranged was not the same as the course which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span>
they were steering. This formation, (A), wherein the advance
is oblique to the front, is very difficult to maintain. Wishing
to make the action, whatever the immediate event, decisive
in results, by drawing the French well to leeward of the port,
Hughes, who was a thorough seaman and had good captains,
played with his eager enemy. "He kept avoiding me without
taking flight," wrote Suffren; "or rather, he fled in
good order, regulating his canvas by his worst sailers; and,
keeping off by degrees, he steered from first to last ten or
twelve different courses." Hughes, on his part, while
perfectly clear as to his own object, was somewhat perplexed
by the seeming indecision of an adversary whose fighting
purpose he knew by experience. "Sometimes they edged
down," he wrote; "sometimes they brought-to; in no regular
order, as if undetermined what to do." These apparent
vacillations were due to the difficulty of maintaining the line
of bearing, which was to be the line of battle; and this
difficulty was the greater, because Hughes was continually
altering his course and Suffren's ships were of unequal speed.</p>

<p>At length, at 2 P.M., being then twenty-five miles south-east
of the port, the French drew near enough to bear down.
That this movement might be carried out with precision,
and all the vessels come into action together, Suffren caused
his fleet to haul to the wind, on the starboard tack, to rectify
the order. This also being done poorly and slowly, he lost
patience,&mdash;as Nelson afterwards said, "A day is soon lost
in man&oelig;uvring,"&mdash;and at 2.30, to spur on the laggard
ships, the French admiral gave the signal to attack, (a), specifying
pistol-range. Even this not sufficing to fetch the delinquents
promptly into line with the flagship, the latter fired a
gun to enforce obedience. Her own side being still turned
towards the British, as she waited, the report was taken by
the flagship's men below decks to be the signal for opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg 249]</span>
fire, and her whole broadside was discharged. This example
was followed by the other ships, so that the engagement,
instead of being close, was begun at half cannon-shot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/249.jpg"><img width="100%" src="images/249.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Hughes and Suffren, September 3, 1782</div>

<p>Owing to his measured and deliberate retreat, Hughes
had his fleet now in thoroughly good shape, well aligned
and closed-up. The French, starting from a poor formation
to perform a difficult evolution, under fire, engaged in utter
disorder (B). Seven ships, prematurely rounding-to to bring
their broadsides to the enemy, and fore-reaching, formed a
confused group (v), much to windward and somewhat ahead
of the British van. Imperfectly deployed, they interfered
with one another and their fire consequently could not be
adequately developed. In the rear a somewhat similar
condition existed. Suffren, expecting the bulk of his line
to fight the British to windward, had directed the <i>Vengeur</i>,
64, and the <i>Consolante</i>, 36, to double to leeward on the
extreme rear; but they, finding that the weather sides of
the enemy were not occupied, feared to go to leeward, lest
they should be cut off. They attacked the rear British ship,
the <i>Worcester</i>, 64 (w), to windward; but the <i>Monmouth</i>, 64
(m), dropping down to her support, and the <i>Vengeur</i> catching
fire in the mizzen top, they were compelled to haul off. Only
Suffren's own ship, the <i>H&#233;ros</i>, 74 (a), and her next astern, the
<i>Illustre</i>, 74, (i), came at once to close action with the British
centre; but subsequently the <i>Ajax</i>, 64, succeeding in clearing
herself from the snarl in the rear, took station ahead (j) of the
<i>H&#233;ros</i>. Upon these three fell the brunt of the fight. They
not only received the broadsides of the ships immediately
opposed to them, but, the wind having now become light yet
free, the British vessels ahead and astern, (h, s,) by luffing or
keeping off, played also upon them. "The enemy formed a
semicircle around us," wrote Suffren's chief of staff, "and
raked us ahead and astern, as the ship came up and fell off
with the helm to leeward." The two seventy-fours were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg 250]</span>
crushed under this fire. Both lost their main and mizzen
masts in the course of the day, and the foretopmast of the
flagship also fell. The <i>Ajax</i>, arriving later, and probably
drawing less attention, had only a topmast shot away.</p>

<p>The British total of killed and wounded was very evenly
distributed throughout the fleet. Only the rear ship lost
an important spar,&mdash;the main topmast. It was upon her, as
already mentioned, and upon the two leading ships, the <i>Exeter</i>
and <i>Isis</i>, that fell the heaviest fire, proportionately, of the
French. From the position of the seven van ships of the
latter, such fire as they could make must needs be upon the
extreme British van, and the <i>Exeter</i> was forced to leave
the line. The loss of the French that day was 82 killed and
255 wounded; of which 64 killed and 178 wounded belonged
to the <i>H&#233;ros</i>, <i>Illustre</i>, and <i>Ajax</i>. The British had 51 killed
and 283 wounded; the greatest number of casualties in one
ship being 56. Singularly enough, in such a small list of
deaths, three were commanding officers: Captains Watt of
the <i>Sultan</i>, Wood of the <i>Worcester</i>, and Lumley of the <i>Isis</i>.</p>

<p>At 5.30 P.M. the wind shifted suddenly from south-west
to east-south-east (C). The British wore together, formed on
the other tack, and continued the fight. It was during this
final act, and at 6 P.M., that the mainmast of the French
flagship came down. The van ships of the French had towed
their heads round with boats before 4, in order to come to
the support of the centre, in obedience to a signal from
Suffren; but the light airs and calms had retarded them.
With the shift they approached, and passed in column (c)
between their crippled vessels and the enemy. This man&oelig;uvre,
and the failure of daylight, brought the battle to an end.
According to Hughes's report, several of his fleet "were
making much water from shot-holes so very low down in the
bottom as not to be come at to be effectually stopped;
and the whole had suffered severely in their masts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg 251]</span>
rigging." Trincomalee being in the enemy's possession, and
the east coast of Ceylon an unsafe anchorage now, at the
change of the monsoon, he felt compelled to return to Madras,
where he anchored on the 9th of September. Suffren regained
Trincomalee on the 7th of the month, but the <i>Orient</i>,
74, running ashore at the entrance and being lost, he remained
outside until the 17th, saving material from the wreck.</p>

<p>The break-up of the south-west monsoon, then at hand, is
apt to be accompanied by violent hurricanes, and is succeeded
by the north-east monsoon, during which the east coasts of
the peninsula and of Ceylon give a lee shore, with heavy surf.
Naval operations, therefore, were suspended for the winter.
During that season Trincomalee is the only secure port.
Deprived of it, Hughes determined to go to Bombay, and
for that purpose left Madras on the 17th of October. Four
days later a reinforcement of five ships of the line arrived
from England, under Commodore Sir Richard Bickerton, who
at once followed the Commander-in-Chief to the west coast.
In the course of December the entire British force was united at Bombay.</p>

<p>In Trincomalee Suffren had a good anchorage; but the
insufficiency of its resources, with other military considerations,
decided him to winter at Acheen, at the west end of
Sumatra. He arrived there on the 2d of November, having
first paid a visit to Cuddalore, where the <i>Bizarre</i>, 64, was
wrecked by carelessness. On the 20th of December he left
Acheen for the Coromandel coast, having shortened his stay
to the eastward for reasons of policy. On the 8th of January,
1783, he was off Ganjam, on the Orissa coast, and thence
reached Trincomalee again on the 23d of February. There
he was joined on the 10th of March by three ships of the line
from Europe: two 74's and one 64. Under their convoy
came General de Bussy, with twenty-five hundred
troops, which were at once despatched to Cuddalore.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span>

<p>On the 10th of April Vice-Admiral Hughes, returning
from Bombay, passed Trincomalee on the way to Madras,
The various maritime occurrences, wrecks and reinforcements,
since the battle of September 3d had reversed the
naval odds, and Hughes now had eighteen ships of the line,
one of which was an eighty, opposed to fifteen under Suffren.
Another important event in the affairs of India was the death
of Hyder Ali, on the 7th of December, 1782. Although his
policy was continued by his son, Tippoo Saib, the blow to
the French was serious. Under all the conditions, the British
authorities were emboldened to attempt the reduction of
Cuddalore. The army destined to this enterprise marched
from Madras, passed round Cuddalore, and encamped
south of it by the shore. The supply-ships and lighter
cruisers anchored near, while the fleet cruised to the southward.
Being there to windward, for the south-west monsoon
had then set in, it covered the operations against disturbance from the sea.</p>

<p>Towards the beginning of June the investment of the place
was complete by land and by water. Intelligence of this
state of things was brought on the 10th of June to Suffren,
who by Bussey's direction was keeping his inferior fleet in
Trincomalee until its services should be absolutely indispensable.
Immediately upon receiving the news he left port,
and on the 13th sighted the British fleet, then at anchor off
Porto Novo, a little south of Cuddalore. Upon his approach
Hughes moved off, and anchored again five miles
from the besieged place. For the next two days the French
were baffled by the winds; but on the 17th the south-west
monsoon resumed, and Suffren again drew near. The
British Vice-Admiral, not caring to accept action at anchor,
got under way, and from that time till the 20th remained
outside, trying to obtain the weather-gage, in which he
was frustrated by the variableness of the winds. Meanwhile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg 253]</span>
Suffren had anchored near the town, communicated
with the general, and, being very short of men at the guns, had
embarked twelve hundred troops for his expected battle;
for it was evident that the issue of the siege would turn
upon the control of the sea. On the 18th he weighed again,
and the two fleets man&oelig;uvred for the advantage, with
light baffling airs, the British furthest from shore.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, the wind holding at west with unexpected
constancy, Hughes decided to accept the attack
which Suffren evidently intended. The latter, being distinctly
inferior in force,&mdash;fifteen to eighteen,&mdash;probably
contemplated an action that should be decisive only as
regarded the fate of Cuddalore; that is, one which, while
not resulting in the capture or destruction of ships, should
compel his opponent to leave the neighbourhood to repair
damages. The British formed line on the port tack, heading
to the northward. Suffren ranged his fleet in the same
manner, parallel to the enemy, and was careful to see the
order exact before bearing down. When the signal to
attack was given, the French kept away together, and
brought-to again on the weather beam of the British, just
within point-blank range. The action lasted from shortly
after 4 P.M. to nearly 7, and was general throughout both
lines; but, as always experienced, the rears were less engaged
than the centres and vans. No ship was taken; no very
important spars seem to have been shot away. The loss
of the British was 99 killed, 434 wounded; of the French,
102 killed, 386 wounded.</p>

<p>As the ships' heads were north, the course of the action
carried them in that direction. Suffren anchored next
morning twenty-five miles north of Cuddalore. There he
was sighted on the 22d by Hughes, who had remained
lying-to the day after the fight. The British Vice-Admiral
reported several ships much disabled, a great number of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span>
men&mdash;1,121&mdash;down with scurvy, and the water of the fleet
very short. He therefore thought it necessary to go to Madras,
where he anchored on the 25th. Suffren regained
Cuddalore on the afternoon of the 23d. His return and
Hughes's departure completely changed the military situation.
The supply-ships, upon which the British scheme of
operations depended, had been forced to take flight when
Suffren first approached, and of course could not come
back now. "My mind is on the rack without a moment's
rest since the departure of the fleet," wrote the commanding
general on the 25th, "considering the character of M. de
Suffren, and the infinite superiority on the part of the French
now that we are left to ourselves."</p>

<p>The battle of June 20th, 1783, off Cuddalore, was the last
of the maritime war of 1778. It was fought, actually,
exactly five months after the preliminaries of peace had been
signed on January 20th, 1783. Although the relative force
of the two fleets remained unchanged, it was a French victory,
both tactically and strategically: tactically, because the
inferior fleet held its ground, and remained in possession
of the field; strategically, because it decided the object
immediately at stake, the fate of Cuddalore, and with it,
momentarily at least, the issue of the campaign. It was, however,
the triumph of one commander-in-chief over another;
of the greater man over the lesser. Hughes's reasons for
quitting the field involve the admission of his opponent's
greater skill. "Short of water,"&mdash;with eighteen ships to
fifteen, able therefore to spare ships by detachments for
watering, that should not have happened; "injury to
spars,"&mdash;that resulted from the action; "1,121 men short,"&mdash;Suffren
had embarked just that number&mdash;1,200&mdash;because
Hughes let him communicate with the port without
fighting. Notwithstanding the much better seamanship
of the British subordinates, and their dogged tenacity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg 255]</span>
Suffren here, as throughout the campaign, demonstrated
again the old experience that generalship is the supreme
factor in war. With inferior resources, though not at
first with inferior numbers, by a steady offensive, and by
the attendant anxiety about Trincomalee impressed upon
the British admiral, he reduced him to a fruitless defensive.
By the seizure of that place as a base he planted himself
firmly upon the scene of action. Able thus to remain,
while the British had to retire to Bombay, he sustained the
Sultan of Mysore in his embarrassing hostility to the British;
and in the end he saved Cuddalore by readiness and dexterity
despite the now superior numbers of the British fleet. He
was a great sea-captain, Hughes was not; and with poorer
instruments, both in men and ships, the former overcame the latter.</p>

<p>On the 29th of June a British frigate, the <i>Medea</i>, bearing
a flag of truce, reached Cuddalore. She brought well-authenticated
intelligence of the conclusion of peace; and
hostilities ceased by common consent.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span>

<p><span class="sc">Random Shot</span>. The extreme range to which a gun could send its shot, giving very uncertain results.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Reef</span>, to. To reduce the surface of a sail.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rudder</span>. A solid framework, pivoted at the stern of a vessel,
which being turned to one side deflects her course. See "Helm" and "Wheel."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sails</span>. Sails are of two kinds: square, and fore and aft. Square
sails spread more across the vessel, in the direction of her
width. Fore and aft sails more in the direction of the
length. Square sails are better for a free wind; and also
for large vessels, because they can be more readily subdivided.
Fore and aft sails trim nearer to the wind, and so are convenient
for coasters, which generally are smaller.</p>

<p class="i2">Vessels carrying square sails are called square-rigged. They have always two masts, usually three; each carrying three or four sails, one above the other. These are named from the mast on which they are carried (see "Spars"); <i>e.g.</i>, <i>main</i> sail, <i>fore</i> topsail, <i>mizzen</i> topgallant-sail; and also from their positions on the same mast. Thus, from lowest up, main sail, main topsail, main topgallantsail; and main royal, if there be a fourth. The fore and main sails are called also courses.</p>

<p class="i2">The topsails were the chief battle sails, because the largest, except the courses, and more manageable than the courses.</p>

<p class="i2">All square-rigged vessels carry fore and aft sails, three cornered, stretched between the bowsprit and jib-booms, and the fore topmast. These sails are called jibs.</p>

<p class="i2">Fore and aft vessels also carry jibs; but on each upright mast they have one great sail, the size of which makes it less easily handled in an emergency, therefore less fit for fighting. Above the big sail they have a small, light, three-cornered topsail, but this is merely a fair weather sail, useless in battle.</p>

<p class="i2">Vessels of war were almost all square-rigged, with three masts.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sails, Studding</span>. Light square sails, for moderate weather, extended
beyond the other square sails, to increase the normal
spread of canvas. Set only with a free wind, and never in battle.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Scantling</span>. The size, and consequent weight and strength, of
the timbers of a vessel's hull.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Schooner</span>. See "Vessel."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Shake</span>, to. So to place a sail that the wind blows along it, neither
filling nor backing. The sail is thus neutralized without taking in.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sharp-up</span>. A yard is sharp-up, when turned by the braces as far
as the rigging of the mast will allow. A close-hauled course
requires the yards to be sharp-up, in order that the sails may be full.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg 263]</span>

<p><span class="sc">Ship</span>. See "Vessel."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Slip</span>. See "Cable."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sloop</span>. See "Vessel."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Spars</span>. A spar is a long piece of timber, cylindrical, tapering,
in masts, towards one end, and in yards towards both.
Spars serve for spreading the several sails of a vessel.</p>

<p class="i2">The names of spars vary with their use and position. Chiefly, for ships of war, they divide into masts, yards, and booms.</p>

<p class="i2">A mast is an upright, and is in three connected pieces: the lower mast, the topmast, and the top-gallant-mast. Most ships of war had three such masts: fore, near the bow; main, near the centre; mizzen, near the stern.</p>

<p class="i2">The bowsprit is also a mast; not upright, but projecting straight ahead from the bow, approaching horizontal, but inclining upwards. Like the masts, it has three divisions: the lower, or bowsprit proper, the jib-boom, and the flying-jib-boom.</p>

<p class="i2">Across the masts, horizontal, are the yards, four in number, lower, topsail, topgallant, and royal. Yards are further designated by the name of the mast to which each belongs; <i>e.g.</i>, foreyard, main topsail yard, mizzen topgallant yard, main royal yard.</p>

<p class="i2">The bowsprit formerly had one yard, called the spritsail yard. This has disappeared. Otherwise it serves to spread the three-cornered sails called jibs. These sails were useful for turning a vessel, because their projection before the centre gave them great leverage.</p>

<p class="i2">Fore and aft vessels had no yards. See "Sails."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Spring</span>. See p. <a href="#page65">65</a>, note.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Square-rigged</span>. See "Sails" and "Spars."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Stand</span>, to. Used, nautically, to express movement and direction,
<i>e.g.</i>, "to stand toward the enemy," "to stand out of harbor,"
"to stand down," "to stand south." The underlying
idea seems to be that of sustained, decided movement.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Starboard</span>. TO the right hand, or on the right side, of a vessel,
looking from aft forward. Opposite to Port.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Steer</span>, to. To control the course by the use of the helm and rudder.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
